## Score State

| row_id | status | score | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| q1 | completed | 4 | Mechanism solves real spec-implementation alignment problem in LLM-assisted development. Problem is explicit, not self-created. | framework/concepts.md, framework/spec_writing_guide.md |
| q2 | completed | 4 | Unit/rule boundaries follow real work shape. Ownership is explicit via repository mapping. | framework/core/repository_mapping.md, framework/spec_writing_guide.md |
| q3 | completed | 4 | Process steps (next, validate, verify, promote) correspond to real information changes. Order reduces uncertainty. | framework/concepts.md |
| q4 | completed | 3 | Promote-as-only-gate creates real downstream gain: no promotion without validated design and verified implementation. | framework/concepts.md |
| q5 | completed | 3 | Design rewards real clarification and surfaces uncertainty. | framework/concepts.md, framework/spec_writing_guide.md |
| q6 | completed | 3 | Hook-injected content (concepts.md) is self-contained. All essential instructions are in a single file. | framework/concepts.md |
| q7 | completed | 3 | Minimum file surface per phase is focused. Tool-enforced rules in specflowctl reduce agent burden. | framework/tooling_execution_policy.md |
| q8 | completed | 3 | Control gained (spec-alignment, deterministic gates) is visible and repeatable. Cost is proportionate. | Full framework design |

## entry_control_chain_check

### Result: passed

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `startup_entry_control` | passed | framework/concepts.md opens with key terms and workflow. |
| `first_owner_selection` | passed | Concepts.md defines spec_validate/spec_verify/spec_promote entry points. |
| `pre_action_permission_gate` | passed | HARD RULE 1: Read specs before implementation. |
| `hard_stop_clarity` | passed | HARD RULE 2: Never promote without validate+verify pass. |
| `owner_reachability` | passed | Concepts.md exposes commands: next, promote, validate, doctor, init, migrate. |

## Cross-Block Convergence Results

| Convergence | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| `design_foundation <-> process_and_gate_design` | passed | Object model (unit/rule, stable/candidate) fully supports promote-as-only-gate process. |
| `design_foundation <-> executor_operability_and_extension` | passed | Hook-injected concepts.md reflects the full governance design. |
| `process_and_gate_design <-> executor_operability_and_extension` | passed | Process steps in concepts.md are directly executable via specflowctl commands. |

## Final Conclusion

**pass-with-optimization**

### Why pass still holds

1. **No hard blockers**: All hard blocker conditions evaluated. None triggered.

2. **All pass gate conditions met**:
   - No score below 2: ✓ (min score = 3)
   - All group averages ≥ 2.5: ✓ (min = 3.0)
   - Weighted score ≥ 75: ✓ (84.75)
   - entry_control_chain_check complete: ✓ (passed)

3. **Design is worth using**: The specFlow design provides real spec-implementation alignment control and deterministic gates. The hook-injected bootstrap model reduces startup overhead compared to the entry-file routing model. Cost is proportionate for governed projects.
