# Unit Stable Verify Command

## 1. Purpose

This command checks whether current code still aligns with a unit's `stable` Spec.

Goals:

1. decide whether current implementation still satisfies the formal truth
2. if drift exists, decide whether code must first return to `stable` semantics before any controlled upgrade round may begin

## 2. Scope

By default it handles:

1. regression checks after changes, fixes, or refactors on units with `Active Layer=stable`
2. alignment checks between `stable` and current code
3. deciding formal-layer deviations and next action
4. confirming current stable acceptance items are specific enough to be verified

It does not:

1. open a new `candidate`
2. design future behavior
3. directly modify code
4. replace structured verification evidence with a subjective summary

### 2.1 Lifecycle-State Advance Inheritance

Lifecycle-state advancement follows `specflow/framework/command_policy.md` Sections 8.5 and 8.8.
This file states only `unit_stable_verify`-local entry, output, and stop rules.

## 3. Preconditions

1. complete required pre-checks
2. the unit's current `Active Layer=stable`
3. `_status.md` says `Next Command=unit_stable_verify`
4. the target unit is explicit
5. the unit has valid `stable`
6. there is actual implementation context that must be checked
7. read any explicitly referenced stable appendix files or bound stable Rule files

## 4. Procedure

1. read `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md` and any required appendix or Rule files
4. verify that the stable `Testability / Acceptance Criteria` section contains explicit acceptance items according to `spec_policy.md` Section 5.5
   - historical stable Specs that still use prose-only acceptance text must not be treated as automatically passing
   - if the stable truth lacks structured acceptance items, report the gap and keep the object at `unit_stable_verify` or route through the smallest legal truth-update path before claiming stable alignment
5. verify current code against key protocols, main flow, error handling, and acceptance criteria in `stable`
6. build a structured verification evidence matrix around acceptance item `id` values:
   - each row must name `acceptance_item_id`, `target`, `verification_surface`, `implementation_surface`, `verification_method`, `evidence`, and `status`
   - `status` must be exactly one of `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, `not_checked`, or `not_runnable_yet`
   - `pass` requires current-round evidence that directly proves the item's `pass_condition`
   - `not_runnable_yet` may be used only when the stable item itself explicitly records `not_runnable_yet` and the current run confirms the same missing runnable surface still exists
   - passing tests that do not prove the item's `pass_condition` must be reported as insufficient evidence, not as `pass`
7. ensure all current-gate acceptance items are covered
8. output `Coverage Summary` with at least:
   - `Total`
   - `Pass`
   - `Fail`
   - `Partial`
   - `Not Checked`
   - `Not Runnable Yet`
9. add risk notes to every `partial`, `not_checked`, and `not_runnable_yet` item
10. classify deviations with the shared severity meanings defined by `specflow/framework/severity_policy.md`
11. conclude:
   - if explicitly referenced stable appendix truth changed enough that the current stable-alignment claim must be re-judged, the result can only be "stable truth drift exists; rerun stable verification against the current stable truth"
   - if any `fail` exists, the result can only be "drift exists; return to stable first"
   - `partial`, `not_checked`, and `not_runnable_yet` are non-blocking only when `specflow/framework/downgrade_policy.md` allows downgrade for the current evidence state
   - if tests pass but do not prove the stable acceptance item, report the evidence gap instead of treating the test result as stable-alignment evidence
   - if key deviations are cleared and evidence is complete, the result is "still aligned with stable"
12. if code, acceptance-item structure, or formal global baseline has drifted from the currently claimed stable state, the next action can only be:
   - return code to `stable` semantics
   - or update stable truth through the smallest legal truth path when the blocker is a missing structured acceptance section rather than code drift
   - or rerun stable-layer verification when the drift is stable-truth-side rather than code-side
   - or refresh the stable-layer verification conclusion against the current formal global baseline when the drift is baseline-side rather than code-side
   - rerun `unit_stable_verify:{unit}` after the required repair or re-judgment work
   - do not open `unit_fork:{unit}` while the current implementation still fails `unit_stable_verify`
13. update `_status.md`:
   - if still aligned -> `Next Command=unit_fork`
   - if drift exists -> keep `Next Command=unit_stable_verify`
   - the deterministic row writeback may be executed with `specflow/tooling/bin/specflowctl-<os>-<arch> status set-object --type unit --object {unit} --stable yes --candidate no --active-layer stable --next-command <unit_fork-or-unit_stable_verify> --notes <status-note>`

## 5. Stop Conditions

1. alignment with `stable` is clear
2. every explicit acceptance item has one allowed status, or missing acceptance-item structure is reported as the blocker
3. the next action is clear
4. `_status.md` is updated

## 6. Output Contract

1. verification conclusion
2. structured verification evidence matrix by acceptance item `id`
3. `Coverage Summary`
5. downgrade decision when `partial`, `not_checked`, or `not_runnable_yet` exists
6. deviation list
7. `fallback_reason_code` when stable alignment cannot be claimed safely
8. next-step recommendation
   - if drift exists, the immediate next step must remain `unit_stable_verify`
   - `unit_fork:{unit}` may be suggested only as a later follow-up after stable alignment has been restored
9. `_status.md` update result
10. the `user-facing close-out block` required by Section 8.6 of `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`
   - `current state` must explicitly confirm `Active Layer=stable` and the written `Next Command`
   - if `Next Command=unit_stable_verify`, `why this next step` must explicitly state that alignment is not yet restored rather than implying a no-op rerun

Allowed `fallback_reason_code` values:

1. `truth_drift`
2. `implementation_deviation`
3. `evidence_incomplete`
4. `rule_drift`
5. `baseline_drift`

## 7. Non-Goals

1. creating `candidate`
2. replacing upgrade design with stable-layer verification
3. directly declaring future behavior as valid
