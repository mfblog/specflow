# Unit Verify Command

## 1. Purpose

This command verifies whether current implementation aligns with the current `candidate`.

## 2. Scope

By default it handles:

1. candidate-versus-implementation alignment verification
2. goal-backward verification from acceptance claims into implementation evidence
3. structured verification evidence generation
4. structural convergence verification for the changed execution surfaces of the round
5. writing `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
6. deciding whether the unit may enter `unit_promote`
7. stopping at a `human_verify` checkpoint only when automation is still insufficient to close confidence
8. confirming that any `system_constraints_change_proposal` claimed by the current candidate is actually reflected in implementation evidence
9. requiring fresh evidence for every pass claim made in the current verification round

### 2.1 Lifecycle-State Advance Inheritance

When this command advances `_status.md`, that advancement inherits the authoritative / non-authoritative central contract defined in Section 8.5 of `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`.
Only a new independent full-scope run of `unit_verify` may produce that advancing result; later local confirmation, narrowed evidence refresh, or scoped follow-up review must not advance lifecycle state.

## 3. Preconditions

1. complete required pre-checks
2. `_status.md` says `Next Command=unit_verify`
3. a current valid `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md` exists
4. a current valid `_plans/active/{unit}.md` exists
5. the candidate still aligns with the current formal global baseline state
6. read required candidate appendix files and bound Shared Contract files
7. if this round may raise a checkpoint, read `specflow/framework/checkpoint_protocol.md`
8. read the git policy if commit-triggering files may change

## 4. Procedure

1. read the candidate Spec, required appendix files, Shared Contract files, pass gate, and plan
2. validate all required bindings
3. if the pass gate or plan is invalid, stop immediately:
   - delete `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_plans/active/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md` if it exists
   - fall back `_status.md` to `unit_check`
4. establish the current-round evidence basis before making any pass claim:
   - evidence must be collected or refreshed in the current `unit_verify` run
   - old test output, previous command output, agent reports, or implementation claims may be used only as pointers to what must be rechecked
   - each evidence item must name the command or inspection used, the checked target, the observed result, and the candidate requirement it proves
   - no acceptance claim may be marked pass without at least one current evidence item
5. verify current code against key protocols, main flow, error handling, acceptance criteria, and any explicit `system_constraints_change_proposal`
6. perform goal-backward verification for each key acceptance claim instead of stopping at artifact existence
7. for each key claim, judge at minimum:
   - `existence`: the required artifact, path, handler, test, or integration point exists
   - `substance`: the artifact contains meaningful implementation rather than hollow placeholder structure
   - `wiring`: the artifact is actually connected to the main execution path, user path, or protocol path required by the current candidate
8. if a required outcome depends on cross-file integration, name that integration path directly in the evidence matrix
9. if implementation pieces exist but are not wired into the claimed path, treat that as `implementation_deviation` rather than as successful existence evidence
10. verify the changed execution surfaces named by the active plan, not just the unit as an undifferentiated whole
11. produce both:
   - the structured verification evidence matrix
   - a `Structure Convergence Matrix`
12. for each changed execution surface in the `Structure Convergence Matrix`, report at minimum:
   - `execution_surface`
   - `behavior_alignment`
   - `target_path_evidence`
   - `legacy_not_required_evidence`
   - `retirement_result`
   - `deviation_reason`
13. treat any of the following as direct `implementation_deviation`:
   - the current execution surface still requires a legacy path before the planned target path can succeed
   - a legacy helper, patch, wrapper, or equivalent dependency named in `Retirement Targets` is still required
   - a new implementation exists but the target path was not actually cut over
   - a core retirement target is not achieved but the round still attempts to enter `unit_promote`
14. output `Coverage Summary`
15. determine whether a `human_verify` checkpoint is required:
   - use it only when automated verification is insufficient but a small amount of human effect judgment can close the remaining uncertainty
   - if human verification confirms implementation deviation while candidate truth still stands, fall back to `unit_impl`
   - if human verification shows acceptance truth itself is still incomplete, fall back to `unit_check`
16. classify deviations with the shared severity meanings defined by `specflow/framework/severity_policy.md`
17. conclude:
   - if `fail` exists, do not enter `unit_promote`
   - if `partial` or `not_checked` exists, promotion is allowed only if `specflow/framework/downgrade_policy.md` allows downgrade for the current evidence state
   - if any key acceptance claim lacks current-round evidence, the result cannot be pass and must remain `not_checked`, `partial`, or `evidence_incomplete`
   - if tests pass but do not prove the candidate requirement, report the gap instead of treating the test result as requirement evidence
   - if key deviations are cleared, retirement targets are satisfied, and evidence is complete, promotion may proceed
18. write or update `docs/specs/_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
19. update `_status.md`:
   - if ready to promote -> `Next Command=unit_promote`
   - if implementation has deviations but candidate truth still stands -> `Next Command=unit_impl`
   - if candidate truth or formal global baseline must be re-closed -> `Next Command=unit_check`
   - if verification evidence is still incomplete but no upstream truth drift exists -> `Next Command=unit_verify`
20. perform git close-out if required

## 5. Stop Conditions

1. candidate-versus-code alignment is clear
2. changed execution surfaces either prove structural convergence or produce an explicit deviation result
3. current-round evidence exists for every pass claim
4. whether promotion is allowed is clear
5. `_status.md` points to the real next executable step
6. if pass gate or plan was invalid, verification stopped and `_status.md` fell back to `unit_check`

## 6. Output Contract

1. verification conclusion
2. structured verification evidence matrix
3. `Structure Convergence Matrix`
4. `Coverage Summary`
5. current-round evidence freshness result
6. goal-backward evidence result
7. downgrade decision when `partial` or `not_checked` exists
8. verify-result write-back result
9. cleanup result when verification fell back to `unit_check`
10. `checkpoint result` when a checkpoint stop was raised
   - when present, it must satisfy the fixed checkpoint fields defined by `specflow/framework/checkpoint_protocol.md`
11. `fallback_reason_code` for fallback or checkpoint stops
12. deviation list
13. fallback reason if pass gate or plan was invalid
14. next-step suggestion
15. git close-out result
16. `_status.md` update result
17. the `user-facing close-out block` required by Section 8.6 of `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`
   - report `round conclusion`, `current state`, `next step`, `why this next step`, and `next-stage entry gap`
   - when a `human_verify` checkpoint was raised, also report `resume signal`
   - if `Next Command` remains `unit_verify` or falls back to `unit_impl`, `why this next step` must explicitly state whether the remaining blocker is missing evidence, human-effect judgment, or implementation deviation

Allowed checkpoint types:

1. `human_verify`

Allowed `fallback_reason_code` values:

1. `gate_missing`
2. `truth_drift`
3. `binding_drift`
4. `baseline_drift`
5. `shared_contract_drift`
6. `implementation_deviation`
7. `evidence_incomplete`
8. `truth_incomplete`

## 7. Non-Goals

1. directly changing code
2. directly rewriting candidate truth
3. advancing an independent `system_constraints` state machine
