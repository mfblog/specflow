# Unit Fork Command

## 1. Purpose

This command forks a new `candidate` Spec from an existing `stable`.

Goals:

1. open a new candidate-design round from the current formal version
2. provide candidate truth for downstream `unit_check / unit_plan / unit_impl`
3. update `docs/specs/_status.md`

## 2. Scope

By default it handles:

1. a new upgrade round for a unit that already has `stable`
2. deriving candidate truth from formal truth

### 2.1 Lifecycle-State Advance Inheritance

Lifecycle-state advancement follows `specflow/framework/command_policy.md` Sections 8.5 and 8.8.
This file states only `unit_fork`-local entry, output, and stop rules.

## 3. Preconditions

1. complete required pre-checks
2. `_status.md` says `Next Command=unit_fork`
3. the unit already has `stable`
4. read `docs/specs/_status.md`
5. read any stable appendix files explicitly referenced by `s_unit_{unit}.md`
6. read bound stable Rule files if `rule_refs` is not empty
7. if the round will create, update, or delete any unit `rule_refs` value or any file under `docs/specs/rules/**`, read `rule_sync.md`
8. if the round may remove, retarget, or otherwise change an existing Rule binding, read every current-layer unit or scenario main file needed to derive the real binding set of each touched Rule from `rule_refs`
9. read `specflow/framework/onboarding_decision_policy.md` for stable-fork candidate source handling
10. read `specflow/framework/candidate_intent_policy.md`; after selecting the target `candidate_intent`, read the selected intent standard named by that policy

## 4. Procedure

1. read `docs/specs/_status.md`
2. read `s_g_rule_repository_baseline.md` if it exists; otherwise continue with no formal global baseline
3. read `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md` and any explicitly referenced appendix files
4. read bound stable Rule files if any
5. determine the target `candidate_intent` before writing the candidate:
   - use `change` for a clean behavior upgrade, extension, replacement, or first selected truth change
   - use `repair` only when the previous `unit_stable_verify` result requires a controlled candidate round to restore current stable truth
   - use `change` when the previous `unit_stable_verify` result says the stable truth, protocol, boundary, or acceptance standard itself must change
   - stop before candidate writeback if the intent cannot be determined from `_status.md`, the prior stable verification conclusion, or the current user-entered command context
6. apply the stable-fork candidate source rule from `specflow/framework/onboarding_decision_policy.md` Section 6.1 together with the selected intent standard
   - if the fork uses only stable formal truth plus the current round's selected design changes, prepare `source_basis=new_design` and `evidence_appendix_ref=none`
   - if the fork selects behavior from implementation, tests, runtime behavior, historical material, or other non-stable evidence, prepare the required `source_basis`, `evidence_appendix_ref`, and candidate evidence appendix in the same round
   - if that source decision or evidence appendix is not ready, stop before writing the candidate main Spec
7. determine the target formal version for this round:
   - compatible new capability -> next `MINOR`
   - incompatible change -> next `MAJOR`
   - compatible fix or alignment -> next `PATCH`
8. generate `docs/specs/units/candidate/c_unit_{unit}.md` from the current stable file and write the prepared `candidate_intent`, `source_basis`, and `evidence_appendix_ref` fields in the same candidate write
   - for `candidate_intent=repair`, also write `repair_basis` and the candidate-only `Repair Scope` required by the selected intent standard
   - for `candidate_intent=change`, do not write `repair_basis`
9. set candidate `frontmatter.version` to that target version
10. ensure the candidate `Testability / Acceptance Criteria` section uses explicit acceptance items that satisfy `spec_writing_guide.md` Section 5
   - if the stable source already has structured acceptance items, carry them forward and edit only the items affected by the new round
   - if the stable source still has historical prose-only acceptance text, convert the relevant current acceptance scope into explicit items in the candidate instead of preserving the ambiguity
11. re-check `rule_refs`:
   - interpret and rewrite that field using the Rule binding contract from `specflow/framework/spec_policy.md` Section 6.1
   - judge Rule bindings independently from whether `s_g_rule_repository_baseline.md` exists
   - if the stable layer depended on rule files and the candidate still depends on the same unchanged rule truth, keep binding those existing rule files in the candidate
   - create or bind candidate-layer rule files only when the current round changes the rule truth itself
   - write `rule_refs=none` only when the current round no longer reuses rule truth
   - do not write `rule_refs=none` merely because a rule-truth change for this round has not yet been formalized
12. if Step 11 removes or retargets any existing Rule binding:
   - derive the real repository-wide binding set of each touched Rule from current-layer unit and scenario `rule_refs` plus the target unit candidate writeback prepared in Step 11
   - if repository truth is insufficient to decide whether any touched Rule file would become unbound after this round, stop and reroute through natural-language rule governance from current repository truth instead of leaving cleanup ownership implicit
13. if the round changed rule bindings or rule files, resolve Rule terminal state in the same round:
   - if a touched Rule file would have no formal bound units after this round, in the same round either delete it when cleanup is legal under `spec_policy.md` or explicitly keep it as independently authored rule truth by writing that file with:
     - `unbound_retention: intentional`
     - `unbound_retention_reason: <why this unbound state is intentional now>`
     - `unbound_retention_owner: unit_fork`
   - reject closure if neither deletion nor explicit keep-writeback has happened for a touched now-unbound Rule file
   - if a touched Rule file still has one or more formal bound units after this round, remove or stop carrying any `unbound_retention`, `unbound_retention_reason`, and `unbound_retention_owner` fields from that resulting bound file state in the same round
   - do not write consumer metadata into touched Rule files; every remaining touched Rule file must omit `bound_objects`
14. close the command with the `candidate_created` outcome:
   - `Stable=yes`
   - `Candidate=yes`
   - `Active Layer=candidate`
   - `Next Command=unit_check`
   - old `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`, `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`, `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`, `_plans/active/{unit}.md`, and previous-round candidate appendix files are deleted by the command close success cleanup
   - the deterministic command closure may be executed with `specflow/tooling/bin/specflowctl-<os>-<arch> command close --command unit_fork --object-type unit --object {unit} --outcome candidate_created --notes <status-note> --apply`
15. do not separately call `status set-object` for normal command closure; that subcommand is a low-level status tool, not the standard `unit_fork` closing entry
16. do not update `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md` only because this fork changed the active layer from `stable` to `candidate`; the current unit main Spec path is resolved from `_status.md` plus the `unit_default` truth-surface rule
17. if the round changed any unit `rule_refs` value or any file under `docs/specs/rules/**`, run `rule_sync` only after `_status.md` already reflects `Active Layer=candidate` for this unit, even when no additional affected object is known yet
   - the deterministic reconciliation part may be executed with `specflow/tooling/bin/specflowctl-<os>-<arch> rule sync-impact --rule-refs <rule-ref> --units {unit}` or the corresponding `--rule-ids` form, and at least one rule trigger input must already be known before this deterministic execution starts
   - if that `rule_sync` returns control because repository truth is still insufficient to continue safely, stop `unit_fork` as `blocked`, keep the newly created candidate-layer state in place, and reroute through natural-language rule governance from current repository truth instead of claiming Rule side effects are closed

## 5. Stop Conditions

1. the new `candidate` exists with valid `candidate_intent`, `source_basis`, and `evidence_appendix_ref`
   - repair candidates also have valid `repair_basis` and `Repair Scope`
2. previous-round process files are cleaned up
3. the new candidate contains explicit acceptance items for the current round
4. Rule side effects are closed
5. `_status.md` is updated
6. if a touched Rule file became unbound because of this round's binding change, its terminal state is already resolved or the command has stopped and rerouted through natural-language rule governance
7. if post-fork `rule_sync` could not continue safely, the command result is `blocked`, the candidate-layer state remains the current formal layer, and the required next step is rerunning natural-language routing from current repository truth so it can re-enter rule governance

## 6. Output Contract

1. fork decision
2. created file path
3. initialized candidate version
4. initialized `candidate_intent`
5. initialized `repair_basis` and `Repair Scope` result when the intent is `repair`
6. initialized `source_basis`
7. initialized `evidence_appendix_ref` and evidence appendix write result when required
8. candidate acceptance-item structure result
9. written formal global baseline reference or `none`
10. Rule terminal-state result when the round changed rule bindings or rule files
11. cleanup result
12. `_status.md` update result
13. Rule reconciliation result when the round changed rule truth or bindings
14. when post-fork `rule_sync` could not continue safely, that the command stopped as `blocked` and must resume through natural-language rule governance
15. the `user-facing close-out block` required by Section 8.6 of `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`
   - `current state` must explicitly confirm the candidate-layer state written to `_status.md`
   - if post-fork follow-up is blocked on rule governance, the block must name natural-language rule-governance rerouting as the immediate `next step`

## 7. Non-Goals

1. directly modifying `stable`
2. directly generating a plan
3. directly entering implementation
4. creating an independent stable `g_` rule candidate file
5. leaving a touched now-unbound Rule file for later guesswork
