# Spec-Driven Development Policy

## 1. Purpose

This file defines the formal truth objects used by `specFlow` in this repository.

It answers six questions:

1. which formal objects exist
2. which files carry those objects
3. how object identity is recorded
4. how bindings, snapshots, and invalidation are anchored
5. how executors must read truth before governance actions
6. how the spec writing guide relates to the governance rules

## 2. Core Object Families

### 2.1 Command-Target Objects

This repository has two command-target truth object families:

1. `unit`
2. `scenario`

Common rules:

1. both families support `stable` and `candidate`
2. both families enter `docs/specs/_status.md`
3. only these two families are standard command targets
4. every candidate main Spec for these families records `source_basis` and `evidence_appendix_ref` as defined by `onboarding_decision_policy.md`
5. every unit candidate main Spec also records `candidate_intent` as defined by `candidate_intent_policy.md`

Family differences:

1. `unit` is the minimal governed unit and is the only family that owns implementation planning and implementation work
2. `scenario` owns trigger-to-outcome chain truth and end-to-end verification, but not implementation planning

### 2.2 `repository_mapping`

`repository_mapping` is the current repository-structure truth.

It answers:

1. what this repository is for
2. which formal objects currently exist
3. which paths belong to which objects or support surfaces
4. which paths are ignored
5. which boundary rules humans and agents must use when judging new paths

It does not answer:

1. one unit's local behavior truth
2. one scenario's trigger-to-outcome chain
3. one reusable rule's body text
4. lifecycle state progression
5. implementation planning or implementation editing

It has one current file:

1. `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md`

It is not a command target.
It does not enter `docs/specs/_status.md`.

### 2.3 `rule`

`rule` is the formal reusable-rule object family.

It answers:

1. which repository-wide default rules are formally active
2. which local reusable rules may be bound by downstream formal objects
3. which exact layer and file carry each rule now
4. which formal objects are currently bound to a bound rule through `rule_refs`

It does not answer:

1. one unit's local behavior truth
2. one scenario's trigger-to-outcome chain
3. repository-structure mapping detail
4. lifecycle state progression
5. implementation planning or implementation editing

Rule files use two formal scopes:

1. `g_` rules are global-scope rules
   - stable `g_` rules are read automatically by every `unit`
   - candidate `g_` rules are proposals and do not apply automatically
2. `b_` rules are bound-scope rules
   - they apply only when a `unit` or `scenario` truth file lists them in `rule_refs`
   - consumers are derived from current-layer `unit` and `scenario` frontmatter `rule_refs`

It is not a command target.
Users enter rule work through the rule-governance branch defined by `natural_language_routing.md`.

## 3. Identity And Files

### 3.1 Object Identity

Formal object identity uses the following rules:

1. `_status.md` records bare object IDs
   - `agent`
   - `ai`
   - `task_execution`
2. file names still carry object family prefixes
   - `c_unit_agent.md`
   - `s_unit_ai.md`
   - `c_scenario_task_execution.md`
3. Rule files must not store consumer refs; consumer refs live only in current-layer `unit` and `scenario` frontmatter `rule_refs`

### 3.2 `unit`

1. `stable` -> `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md`
2. `candidate` -> `docs/specs/units/candidate/c_unit_{unit}.md`

### 3.3 `scenario`

1. `stable` -> `docs/specs/scenarios/stable/s_scenario_{scenario}.md`
2. `candidate` -> `docs/specs/scenarios/candidate/c_scenario_{scenario}.md`

### 3.4 `repository_mapping`

1. current -> `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md`

### 3.5 `rule`

1. `stable` -> `docs/specs/rules/stable/*.md`
2. `candidate` -> `docs/specs/rules/candidate/*.md`

### 3.6 `_status.md`

`docs/specs/_status.md` is the formal object-state index file.

It records rows for:

1. `unit`
2. `scenario`

Required columns are:

1. `Object Type`
2. `Object`
3. `Stable`
4. `Candidate`
5. `Active Layer`
6. `Next Command`
7. `Notes`

`_status.md` is not behavior truth.
It is the state index that commands must keep aligned with current governance state.

### 3.7 Command-Target Truth Path Resolution

Command-target truth paths are resolved from two inputs:

1. `docs/specs/_status.md`
   - selects the current `Active Layer` for each `unit` or `scenario`
2. the fixed file templates in Sections 3.2 and 3.3
   - define the stable and candidate main Spec file path for that object family

Rules:

1. `_status.md` is the only source for the current layer.
2. `repository_mapping.md` records the truth-surface rule name for each command-target object, not the current active file path.
3. A command must resolve the current main Spec path by applying the object's `Active Layer` to the fixed template for that object family.
4. `unit_promote`, `unit_fork`, `scenario_promote`, and `scenario_fork` change `_status.md` and the relevant truth files; they must not update `repository_mapping.md` only because the active layer changed.
5. `repository_mapping.md` changes only when the object map, path template rule, implementation surface, rule truth path, support surface, governed root, ignore rule, or conflict rule changes.
6. Process snapshots may keep historical `truth_file_ref` values because they describe the truth file used at the time the process snapshot was created.

## 4. Object Boundaries

### 4.1 `unit`

`unit` is the minimal governed unit.

It answers:

1. what responsibility the unit owns
2. which truth surface and implementation surface belong to it
3. which local behavior, protocol, state, and acceptance rules define it
4. how that unit is validated
5. where repairs must land first when the unit is wrong

It must not silently mean:

1. one directory
2. one package
3. one service
4. one bounded context

### 4.2 `scenario`

`scenario` is the formal trigger-to-outcome chain object.

It answers:

1. what triggers the chain
2. which units it traverses
3. which rules it reuses
4. what success means
5. where failure is absorbed, surfaced, or rolled back
6. how the chain is verified end to end

It does not own:

1. unit-local implementation detail
2. rule body text
3. repository mapping rules
4. direct implementation editing

### 4.3 `repository_mapping`

`repository_mapping` is the repository structure truth file.

It answers these mandatory sections:

1. `Project Overview`
   - what this repository is for
   - the main delivery surface
   - the shortest useful reading path
2. `Object Registry`
   - current `unit` IDs and one-line responsibilities
   - current `scenario` IDs and one-line responsibilities, or `none`
   - current `rule` IDs and one-line responsibilities
3. `Boundary Rules`
   - what qualifies as a formal `unit`
   - what must become `rule`
   - what stays outside command-target truth
4. `Path Ownership`
   - which roots are governed
   - which paths are ignored
   - which path rules and implementation surfaces map to which current formal object
   - how conflicts are decided
5. `Rule Alignment`
   - which stable `g_` rules currently constrain the repository mapping
6. `Drift Handling`
   - what counts as mapping drift
   - how consumers must stop when drift is found

It does not own:

1. unit-local behavior truth
2. rule body text
3. scenario-local chain detail
4. implementation planning or implementation editing
5. command lifecycle state

### 4.4 `rule`

`rule` answers:

1. one global or bound reusable rule
2. not the whole unit
3. not the whole scenario
4. not the whole repository mapping
5. not the whole global baseline

When a candidate-layer rule file already has a stable-layer sibling for the same `rule_id`, that candidate file also owns the explicit next-landing owner for the reopened rule round.

## 5. Required Binding Fields

The required spec fields, acceptance criteria format, and content organization rules are defined by `specflow/framework/spec_writing_guide.md`.
This section defines only the governance-side conditional fields that apply to rule files.

### 5.1 Rule Conditional Fields

Conditional field:

1. when a candidate-layer rule file already has a stable-layer sibling for the same `rule_id`, that candidate file must also record exactly one `promotion_owner_unit`
   - it must be a bare unit id
   - it must name one formal unit from current repository truth
   - it is the only unit round allowed to land that candidate rule file as the next stable-layer Rule file
2. when a candidate-layer rule file does not have a stable-layer sibling, `promotion_owner_unit` must not be recorded
3. stable-layer rule files must not record `promotion_owner_unit`
4. when a command or rule-governance flow explicitly keeps a touched bound rule file with no current formal bindings as independently authored rule truth, that same file must record exactly these intentional-unbound retention fields:
   - `unbound_retention: intentional`
   - `unbound_retention_reason: <non-empty reason>`
   - `unbound_retention_owner: <owning command or rule-governance flow>`
5. `unbound_retention_owner` must name the command or internal rule-governance flow that owns the terminal-state decision in the current round, for example `unit_fork`, `unit_promote`, or `rule_topology`
6. the intentional-unbound retention fields may be recorded only when the current-layer `unit` and `scenario` `rule_refs` graph contains no consumer for that Rule ref
7. when the current-layer `unit` and `scenario` `rule_refs` graph contains one or more consumers for the resulting Rule ref, the intentional-unbound retention fields must not be recorded
8. when a file that previously carried intentional-unbound retention becomes formally bound again, the same round that restores the binding must remove `unbound_retention`, `unbound_retention_reason`, and `unbound_retention_owner`
9. intentional-unbound retention fields are terminal-state truth for the rule file only; they do not replace `rule_refs`, do not create a formal binding, and do not skip required `rule_sync` or `impact_sync` reconciliation

## 6. Binding Contracts

### 6.1 Rule Binding Contract

When current-layer truth records `rule_refs`, executors must treat that field as the only formal source of which rule files are currently bound.

Rules:

1. `rule_refs` must name the exact layer and file currently bound
2. stable-layer command-target objects may bind only stable-layer rule truth
3. candidate-layer command-target objects may bind stable-layer or candidate-layer rule truth, but the bound layer must be explicit
4. `rule_refs` must be recorded in frontmatter
5. an object with no formal Rule binding must record `rule_refs: none` in frontmatter
6. the body may explain reuse through `rule_reuse_summary` and `rule_exceptions`, but it must not contain the formal `rule_refs` list
7. Rule files must not record `bound_objects`; consumer lists are derived only by scanning current-layer `unit` and `scenario` frontmatter `rule_refs`
8. when `rule_refs` is written as a YAML list, executors must normalize the ref order by exact rule ref string in ascending lexical order
9. during a same-round stable landing by `unit_promote`, consumer retargeting must be performed through `specflowctl rule release-version`
10. `release-version` may directly rewrite candidate current-layer `rule_refs`
11. `release-version` must not directly rewrite stable current-layer truth; it must create a candidate fork and rewrite the candidate `rule_refs`
12. a retargeted candidate object's process files are no longer reusable and must fall back to `unit_check` or `scenario_check` through rule impact reconciliation

### 6.2 Dependency Direction Contract

Formal dependency direction is fixed:

1. `repository_mapping -> unit/scenario/rule`
2. `stable g_ rule -> rule/unit/scenario/repository_mapping`
3. `rule -> unit/scenario`
4. `unit -> scenario`

Downstream invalidation rule:

1. upstream change may invalidate downstream process files or stable-alignment claims
2. downstream change does not automatically invalidate upstream truth

### 6.3 Promotion Dependency Reference Retarget Contract

When `unit_promote:{unit}` lands `docs/specs/units/candidate/c_unit_{unit}.md` as `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md`, the promote command may mechanically retarget existing formal Spec references to that same unit from the candidate layer to the stable layer in the same round.

This is a narrow reference-maintenance exception. It is not a general stable truth editing permission.

Rules:

1. the retarget may change only the promoted unit's path or version ref:
   - `docs/specs/units/candidate/c_unit_{unit}.md` to `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md`
   - relative paths that resolve to the same candidate file to relative paths that resolve to the same stable file
   - `c_unit_{unit}@<version>` to `s_unit_{unit}@<same-version>`
2. the retarget must preserve the same referenced unit, same promoted version, same behavior meaning, same acceptance meaning, same ownership boundary, and same Rule binding meaning
3. the retarget must stop instead of editing when the reference text carries candidate-only meaning, including claims that the dependency is temporary, not formally accepted, unresolved, or only valid while the target remains candidate-layer truth
4. a current-layer stable unit other than the promoted unit retargeted this way must not be forked only because of the mechanical reference update; its `_status.md` row must instead move to `Next Command=unit_stable_verify`
5. a current-layer stable scenario retargeted this way must not be forked only because of the mechanical reference update; its `_status.md` row must instead move to `Next Command=scenario_stable_verify`
6. the promoted unit's own newly written stable file may be retargeted as part of the same stable landing, and that self-retarget must not replace the promoted unit's successful `Next Command=unit_fork` follow-up state
7. a current-layer candidate unit or scenario retargeted this way must fall back to its check command because its current process files were written against the old dependency path
8. non-current historical files may be mechanically retargeted when the same narrow conditions hold, but they do not update `_status.md` merely because they are not the active truth layer
9. the promote command must include every retargeted file, affected status row, and candidate-side process file cleanup in its incomplete-promotion recovery baseline

### 6.4 Version Contract

Formal version values use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Unit `stable` version meaning:

1. `MAJOR`
   - incompatible formal contract change
2. `MINOR`
   - new capability or compatible behavior change in the formal contract
3. `PATCH`
   - implementation-only fix or alignment-only fix against the current aligned layer

`s_g_rule_repository_baseline.md` version meaning:

1. `MAJOR`
   - incompatible global constraint change
2. `MINOR`
   - new global default rule, reusable mechanism, or compatible extension
3. `PATCH`
   - wording-only clarification that does not change the meaning of formal constraints

Rule version rules:

1. `rule_version` uses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
2. The first candidate-layer file for a brand-new rule object starts at `0.1.0`.
3. When a current round opens the next candidate-layer file for a rule object that already has a stable-layer file, that candidate file must carry the intended next stable `rule_version`.
4. When Rule 3 applies, that candidate file must also record the exact `promotion_owner_unit` required by Section 5.1.
5. `MAJOR`
   - incompatible change to the formally bound rule semantics, required consumer interpretation, or cross-unit contract shape
6. `MINOR`
   - compatible rule-truth extension, additional reusable capability, or compatible topology evolution that requires consumer awareness but not contract breakage
7. `PATCH`
   - wording-only clarification, compatible tightening, or alignment-only update that does not change the required consumer interpretation

Candidate content may change frequently.
It enters formal version semantics only when promoted into a new `stable`.

## 7. Reading Rules

Before any governance action:

1. read the target object's current-layer main file
2. read any explicitly required appendix truth for that object family
3. read bound rule files when `rule_refs` is not empty
4. read `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md` when object boundary, path ownership, support surface, or current object map matters

Additional rules:

1. do not guess bindings by scanning unrelated files first
2. do not treat natural-language mentions as formal bindings
3. do not skip explicitly bound current-layer truth

## 8. Process Files And Snapshots

Process files are not behavior truth.
They are current-round derived artifacts.

Process containers by object family:

1. `unit`
   - `_check_result`
   - `_plans`
   - `_verify_result`
2. `scenario`
   - `_check_result`
   - `_verify_result`

Object-owned snapshot extensions are fixed by object type:

1. `unit`
   - `unit_appendix_snapshot`
   - `rule_snapshot`
2. `scenario`
   - `repository_mapping_snapshot`
   - `unit_snapshot`
   - `scenario_appendix_snapshot`
   - `rule_snapshot`

Process files become invalid when their required current truth or required current bindings no longer match.

Candidate evidence appendix files are candidate appendix files for snapshot and invalidation purposes.
Their inclusion in `unit_appendix_snapshot` or the scenario candidate snapshot proves which evidence was reviewed by the gate, but it does not make the evidence appendix an implementation truth source.
Implementation and verification commands must use the candidate main Spec, retained behavior rules, bound Rule files, and `s_g_rule_repository_baseline.md` as truth.
Appendix files must not store the main Spec version in frontmatter; their current binding is derived from the current-layer main Spec link, owner fields, layer, and content fingerprint.

The exact snapshot field definitions come from `process_snapshot_contract.md`.

## 9. Invalidation And Reconciliation

When upstream truth or binding changes:

1. invalidate downstream process files deterministically
2. classify the affected process surface through the layered recovery rules in `recovery_policy.md`
3. fall back the downstream object to the nearest legal next step for that failed layer
4. keep Rule topology reconciliation and generic impact reconciliation separate

Formal routing remains:

1. `rule_sync` for rule-governance downstream discovery
2. `impact_sync` for generic fallback and cleanup once the affected downstream object set is fixed

## 10. Relationship to Other Framework Documents

1. The spec writing rules (required fields, acceptance criteria format, content organization) are defined by `specflow/framework/spec_writing_guide.md`.
2. Commands and governance flows that need to check spec content must reference `specflow/framework/spec_writing_guide.md` directly, not the writing-related sections formerly in this file.
