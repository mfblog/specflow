# Candidate Handoff Contract

## 1. Purpose

This file defines the shared handoff contract for the candidate-side command chain.

It answers five questions:

1. what each downstream step minimally requires from the upstream step
2. which bindings must be re-validated before consuming that handoff
3. which fallback step is the smallest valid recovery point when the handoff is invalid
4. which standardized `fallback_reason_code` must be used
5. how this contract relates to process-file READMEs and command files

This file is a centralized contract document. It does not replace command-specific procedure text.

---

## 2. Standard Reason Taxonomy

Candidate-side fallback, blocking, and resume explanations must use these standard `fallback_reason_code` values:

1. `truth_incomplete`
2. `gate_missing`
3. `truth_drift`
4. `binding_drift`
5. `baseline_drift`
6. `rule_drift`
7. `shared_truth_conflict`
8. `governance_drift`
9. `implementation_deviation`
10. `evidence_incomplete`
11. `implementation_unknown`
12. `direction_unresolved`
13. `stable_dependency_not_ready`
14. `promotion_recovery`
15. `plan_layer`
16. `gate_layer`
17. `evidence_layer`
18. `dependency_readiness_layer`

Meaning rules:

1. `truth_incomplete`
   - the current candidate truth is still missing user-intent, boundary, protocol, or acceptance content needed for stable downstream work
2. `gate_missing`
   - a required upstream pass gate or plan file does not exist or no longer qualifies as a current valid gate
3. `truth_drift`
   - the candidate truth changed and the old downstream artifact no longer matches it
4. `binding_drift`
   - a process file still exists but its required bindings no longer match the current truth
5. `baseline_drift`
   - the formal global baseline relation no longer matches the current round
6. `rule_drift`
   - a bound `rule` truth, layer, version, body, or binding changed enough to invalidate the handoff
7. `shared_truth_conflict`
   - the current required reading range already confirms that the same formal behavior truth is defined twice and shared closure must happen before downstream work may continue
8. `governance_drift`
   - a required governance surface, registry, or framework-owned execution rule is missing, invalid, or contradictory enough that the current command cannot safely continue under the formal mechanism
9. `implementation_deviation`
   - implementation no longer satisfies the current candidate even though candidate truth still stands
10. `evidence_incomplete`
   - current verification evidence is still insufficient to close the next gate safely
11. `implementation_unknown`
   - candidate truth still stands, but bounded implementation-critical unknowns, external conditions, or missing implementation facts still prevent a stable plan from being written
12. `direction_unresolved`
   - candidate truth still stands, but more than one materially different implementation direction remains viable and a user decision is required before a stable plan may be written
13. `stable_dependency_not_ready`
   - `scenario_promote` cannot write stable scenario truth because one or more current `unit_refs` or `rule_refs` entries are candidate-layer, missing, or not safely resolvable as stable-layer dependencies
14. `promotion_recovery`
   - a promote command had already started mutating repository state and had to restore the target object back to candidate semantics before the chain could continue
15. `plan_layer`
   - the unit active plan is missing, malformed, not tool-valid, or incomplete while the current unit check gate still covers current truth
16. `gate_layer`
   - a check gate is missing, malformed, or not tool-valid while current truth and bindings still match
17. `evidence_layer`
   - verification evidence is missing, malformed, stale, or incomplete while truth and upstream process artifacts still stand
18. `dependency_readiness_layer`
   - scenario promotion is blocked only because a required dependency is not stable-ready yet

Executors may add natural-language explanation, but the standardized code must appear first when a fallback or blocking reason is reported.

## 3. Handoff: `unit_check -> unit_plan`

### 3.1 Minimum Upstream Artifact

`unit_plan` minimally requires a current valid `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`.

### 3.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `unit_plan` must re-validate:

1. `decision=pass`
2. `allow_next=true`
3. `next_command=unit_plan`
4. `truth_layer_ref`, `truth_file_ref`, `truth_version_ref`, and `truth_fingerprint` against the current candidate truth
5. current `unit_appendix_snapshot`
6. current stable `g_` rule binding fields
7. current `rule_snapshot`
8. the accepted acceptance-item set recorded by `unit_check` against the current candidate `Testability / Acceptance Criteria` section

### 3.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`unit_plan` may continue only when the pass gate still covers the current candidate round exactly.
When `unit_appendix_snapshot` includes a candidate evidence appendix, the snapshot means only that the same evidence appendix was reviewed by the gate.
It does not allow `unit_plan` to derive implementation requirements from that appendix.
The accepted acceptance-item set is the only acceptance set `unit_plan` may map into implementation slices and verification targets.

### 3.4 Smallest Fallback

If the handoff is invalid, the smallest fallback is `unit_check`.

### 3.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `truth_incomplete`
2. `gate_missing`
3. `truth_drift`
4. `binding_drift`
5. `baseline_drift`
6. `rule_drift`
7. `implementation_unknown`
8. `direction_unresolved`

---

## 4. Handoff: `unit_plan -> unit_impl`

### 4.1 Minimum Upstream Artifacts

`unit_impl` minimally requires both:

1. a current valid `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
2. a current valid `_plans/active/{unit}.md`

### 4.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `unit_impl` must re-validate:

1. all required `_check_result` bindings from Section 3
2. current plan file path and existence
3. plan-bound `spec_file_ref`, `spec_version_ref`, and `spec_fingerprint`
4. plan-bound `unit_appendix_snapshot`
5. plan-bound stable `g_` rule fields
6. plan-bound `rule_snapshot`
7. plan coverage of the current candidate acceptance-item `id` set

### 4.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`unit_impl` may continue only when both the pass gate and the plan still cover the same current candidate round.
When a candidate evidence appendix is present in the pass gate or plan appendix snapshot, `unit_impl` must treat it as reviewed evidence only.
Implementation requirements come from the candidate main Spec, the active plan, bound Rule files, and the current global baseline.
If a current-gate acceptance item is not covered by the active plan, the handoff is invalid because implementation would no longer be working from the complete accepted target.

### 4.4 Smallest Fallback

If the check gate is missing or invalid because truth or bindings drifted, the smallest fallback is `unit_check`.
If the active plan is missing, malformed, not tool-valid, or does not cover the current acceptance item ids while the check gate still covers current truth, the smallest fallback is `unit_plan`.

### 4.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `gate_missing`
2. `truth_drift`
3. `binding_drift`
4. `baseline_drift`
5. `rule_drift`
6. `gate_layer`
7. `plan_layer`

---

## 5. Handoff: `unit_impl -> unit_verify`

### 5.1 Minimum Upstream Artifacts

`unit_verify` minimally requires both:

1. a current valid `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
2. a current valid `_plans/active/{unit}.md`

### 5.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `unit_verify` must re-validate:

1. all required gate bindings
2. all required plan bindings
3. that the implementation state still matches the coverage scope claimed by the current round's plan progress
4. that the active plan's verification targets still cover the current candidate acceptance-item `id` set

### 5.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`unit_verify` may continue only when verification still targets the same candidate truth round that implementation used.
The evidence matrix must be organized by the candidate acceptance item `id` set that the active plan covered.

### 5.4 Smallest Fallback

If bindings drift, the smallest fallback is `unit_check`.
If the active plan is missing, malformed, not tool-valid, or does not cover the current acceptance item ids while the check gate still covers current truth, the smallest fallback is `unit_plan`.
If candidate truth still stands but implementation diverged, the fallback is `unit_impl`.

### 5.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `gate_missing`
2. `truth_drift`
3. `binding_drift`
4. `baseline_drift`
5. `rule_drift`
6. `implementation_deviation`
7. `evidence_incomplete`
8. `truth_incomplete`
9. `plan_layer`
10. `evidence_layer`

---

## 6. Handoff: `unit_verify -> unit_promote`

### 6.1 Minimum Upstream Artifact

`unit_promote` minimally requires a current valid `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`.

### 6.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `unit_promote` must re-validate:

1. `decision=pass`
2. `allow_next=true`
3. `next_command=unit_promote`
4. `truth_layer_ref`, `truth_file_ref`, `truth_version_ref`, and `truth_fingerprint` against the current candidate truth
5. current `unit_appendix_snapshot`
6. current implementation still covered by `verification_scope_ref`
7. current stable `g_` rule binding fields
8. current `rule_snapshot`
9. current acceptance-item `id` set and every current-gate item's verification status in `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`

### 6.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`unit_promote` may continue only when the verify result still covers current candidate truth, current implementation, and current baseline state together.
It must also confirm that `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md` covers the current candidate acceptance-item set exactly.
If candidate acceptance items changed after verification, promotion must not continue on the older evidence matrix.

### 6.4 Smallest Fallback

If verification evidence is outdated or incomplete but candidate truth still stands, the smallest fallback is `unit_verify`.
If implementation no longer aligns with the candidate, the fallback is `unit_impl`.
If candidate truth or upstream bindings drifted, the fallback is `unit_check`.

### 6.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `truth_drift`
2. `binding_drift`
3. `baseline_drift`
4. `rule_drift`
5. `implementation_deviation`
6. `evidence_incomplete`

---

## 7. Handoff: `scenario_check -> scenario_verify`

### 7.1 Minimum Upstream Artifact

`scenario_verify` minimally requires a current valid `_check_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`.

### 7.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `scenario_verify` must re-validate:

1. `decision=pass`
2. `allow_next=true`
3. `next_command=scenario_verify`
4. `truth_layer_ref`, `truth_file_ref`, `truth_version_ref`, and `truth_fingerprint` against the current candidate scenario truth
5. current `repository_mapping_snapshot`
6. current `unit_snapshot`
7. current stable `g_` rule binding fields
8. current `rule_snapshot`
9. the accepted scenario acceptance-item set against the current scenario `Testability / Acceptance Criteria` section

### 7.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`scenario_verify` may continue only when the pass gate still covers the current scenario candidate round exactly.
The verify run must use the accepted scenario acceptance-item set as its evidence matrix spine.

### 7.4 Smallest Fallback

If scenario truth, repository mapping, unit bindings, Rule bindings, baseline, or acceptance item ids drifted, the smallest fallback is `scenario_check`.
If the scenario check gate is missing, malformed, or not tool-valid while current scenario truth and bindings still match, the smallest fallback is `scenario_check` as a gate rebuild, not a truth fallback.
If current `repository_mapping_snapshot` no longer matches `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md`, use `binding_drift`.

### 7.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `gate_missing`
2. `truth_drift`
3. `binding_drift`
4. `baseline_drift`
5. `rule_drift`
6. `gate_layer`

---

## 8. Handoff: `scenario_verify -> scenario_promote`

### 8.1 Minimum Upstream Artifact

`scenario_promote` minimally requires a current valid `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`.

### 8.2 Required Re-Validation

Before consumption, `scenario_promote` must re-validate:

1. `decision=pass`
2. `allow_next=true`
3. `next_command=scenario_promote`
4. `truth_layer_ref`, `truth_file_ref`, `truth_version_ref`, and `truth_fingerprint` against the current candidate scenario truth
5. current `repository_mapping_snapshot`
6. current `unit_snapshot`
7. current `verification_scope_ref`
8. current stable `g_` rule binding fields
9. current `rule_snapshot`
10. current scenario acceptance-item `id` set and every current-gate item's verification status in `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
11. stable dependency readiness for the current candidate scenario:
   - every current `unit_refs` entry resolves to existing stable-layer unit truth
   - every current `rule_refs` entry resolves to existing stable-layer Rule truth, unless the formal value is `none`
   - candidate-layer, missing, or unresolved dependency refs are not consumable by `scenario_promote`

### 8.3 Allowed Entry Condition

`scenario_promote` may continue only when the verify result still covers current candidate scenario truth, current repository mapping, current bound units, current bound Rule files, current verification scope, and current formal global baseline state together.
It must also confirm that `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md` covers the current scenario acceptance-item set exactly.
It must also confirm stable dependency readiness before any stable scenario truth writeback.

### 8.4 Smallest Fallback

If verification evidence is outdated or incomplete but the check gate still covers current truth, the smallest fallback is `scenario_verify`.
If candidate scenario truth or upstream bindings drifted, the smallest fallback is `scenario_check`.
If current `repository_mapping_snapshot` no longer matches `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md`, the smallest fallback is `scenario_check` with `binding_drift`.
If stable dependency readiness fails because a dependency is candidate-layer, missing, or not safely resolvable, `scenario_promote` must stop before stable writeback, keep candidate semantics, report the affected dependency and its current legal next step from `_status.md` when present, and remain at `scenario_promote` under `dependency_readiness_layer`.
After dependency landing, `scenario_promote` must revalidate the current verify handoff and stable dependency readiness before promotion. A fresh `scenario_check` and `scenario_verify` are required only when scenario truth, scenario bindings, repository mapping, Rule bindings, baseline, acceptance item ids, or verification evidence changed.

### 8.5 Allowed Reason Codes

Use only:

1. `truth_drift`
2. `binding_drift`
3. `baseline_drift`
4. `rule_drift`
5. `evidence_incomplete`
6. `stable_dependency_not_ready`
7. `evidence_layer`
8. `dependency_readiness_layer`

## 9. Relationship To Other Files

This handoff contract works together with:

1. `specflow/framework/spec_policy.md`
2. `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`
3. `specflow/framework/commands/*.md`
4. process-file READMEs under `docs/specs/` and `specflow/templates/docs/specs/`
5. `specflow/framework/process_snapshot_contract.md`
6. `specflow/framework/recovery_policy.md`

Priority rules:

1. policy files define the top-level governance rules
2. this file defines the centralized candidate-chain handoff contract
3. command files define command-local procedure and output details consistent with this contract
4. process-file READMEs define file-specific consumption and invalidation semantics consistent with this contract

---

## 10. Non-Goals

This file does not:

1. define new commands
2. redefine unit behavior truth
3. replace command-specific stop conditions
4. expand process-file fixed snapshot fields by itself
