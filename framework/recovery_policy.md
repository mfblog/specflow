# Recovery Policy

## 1. Purpose

This file defines the centralized recovery rules used when a Spec Flow round cannot safely continue after repository mutation or after downstream invalidation has already started.

It answers five questions:

1. what recovery means in this repository
2. which object families use centralized recovery
3. how candidate-side fallback cleanup works
4. how incomplete promotion recovery works
5. which repository state may be claimed after recovery

This file does not replace command-local stop conditions.
It defines the shared repository-restoration baseline.

## 2. Scope

This policy covers:

1. candidate-side recovery for:
   - `unit`
   - `scenario`
2. incomplete promotion recovery for:
   - `unit_promote`
   - `scenario_promote`

Boundary:

1. the active command still decides when recovery is entered
2. `impact_sync` may execute deterministic fallback cleanup
3. this file defines the repository state that recovery must restore

## 3. Core Terms

### 3.1 Recovery

`recovery` means:

1. stop claiming the current round succeeded
2. restore the repository to a state that the next legal command can safely consume
3. update `_status.md` so the next action is explicit

### 3.2 Recovery Baseline

`recovery baseline` means the exact pre-mutation snapshot a command captures before it starts overwriting or deleting governance files.

It is not:

1. a truth file
2. a process file
3. a new lifecycle stage

### 3.3 Incomplete Promotion Recovery

`incomplete promotion recovery` means the special recovery path used when a promote command already mutated repository truth, but the round cannot be safely closed as a completed promotion.

## 4. Candidate-Side Recovery Baseline

For candidate-side invalidation:

1. classify the failed surface before choosing a fallback target
2. use the nearest command that owns rebuilding or reproving that failed surface
3. update `_status.md` to the smallest legal next step
4. delete only the failed process layer and process files downstream of that layer
5. do not invent extra temporary states

### 4.1 Failure Layers

Candidate-side recovery uses these fixed layers:

1. `truth_layer`
   - candidate truth, acceptance item set, Rule snapshot, global baseline, repository mapping, or formal binding meaning changed
   - fallback target:
     - `unit -> unit_check`
     - `scenario -> scenario_check`
2. `gate_layer`
   - the check gate is missing, malformed, or not tool-valid, while current truth and current bindings still match
   - fallback target:
     - `unit -> unit_check`
     - `scenario -> scenario_check`
3. `plan_layer`
   - the unit active plan is missing, malformed, not tool-valid, or no longer covers the current acceptance item ids, while the unit check gate still covers current truth
   - fallback target:
     - `unit -> unit_plan`
   - this layer does not apply to `scenario`
4. `implementation_layer`
   - implementation no longer satisfies the current unit truth and current active plan, while both upstream process layers remain valid
   - fallback target:
     - `unit -> unit_impl`
   - this layer does not allow `scenario` to repair units; scenario verification must report affected units instead
5. `evidence_layer`
   - verification evidence is missing, stale, incomplete, or malformed, while truth, check gate, and any required plan still stand
   - fallback target:
     - `unit -> unit_verify`
     - `scenario -> scenario_verify`
6. `dependency_readiness_layer`
   - `scenario_promote` found a required unit or Rule dependency that is candidate-layer, missing, or not safely resolvable as stable, while scenario truth and verification evidence still stand
   - fallback target:
     - `scenario -> scenario_promote`
   - this layer waits for dependency landing or scenario binding writeback; it does not delete scenario check or verify process files by itself

Layer rules:

1. only `truth_layer` permits deleting every current candidate-side process artifact for the object
2. `gate_layer` deletes the check gate only
3. `plan_layer` deletes unit draft plan, unit active plan, and unit verify result
4. `implementation_layer` deletes only verification results that can no longer remain current
5. `evidence_layer` deletes only verification results
6. `dependency_readiness_layer` deletes no scenario process files unless a separate truth or evidence layer is also proven

### 4.2 Default Candidate Cleanup Map

1. `unit truth_layer -> unit_check`
   - delete `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_plans/active/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
2. `unit gate_layer -> unit_check`
   - delete `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
3. `unit plan_layer -> unit_plan`
   - delete `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_plans/active/{unit}.md`
   - delete `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
4. `unit implementation_layer -> unit_impl`
   - delete `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
5. `unit evidence_layer -> unit_verify`
   - delete `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
6. `scenario truth_layer -> scenario_check`
   - delete `_check_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
   - delete `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
7. `scenario gate_layer -> scenario_check`
   - delete `_check_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
8. `scenario evidence_layer -> scenario_verify`
   - delete `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
9. `scenario dependency_readiness_layer -> scenario_promote`
   - delete no process files

Plain meaning:

1. candidate-side drift does not create a second state machine
2. recovery rewinds only to the nearest step that can rebuild or reprove the failed layer
3. a process artifact format error is not automatically a truth error
4. a command must not keep using a process file that failed its required tool validation

### 4.3 Deterministic Cleanup Tool Contract

When the repository provides deterministic cleanup tooling, candidate-side cleanup must use that tooling instead of ad hoc file deletion.

Rules:

1. the current cleanup entry is `specflowctl process cleanup-fallback --object-type unit|scenario --object <object> --from-command <command> --reason <code> --failure-layer <layer>`
2. the cleanup tool must cover every failure layer listed in Section 4.1 for the object family it supports
3. if the cleanup tool reports that no deterministic cleanup is defined for a command-declared failure layer, the executor must stop and report a specFlow tooling gap
4. when Rule 3 applies, the executor must not manually delete process files, manually rewrite `_status.md`, or claim fallback cleanup complete
5. success cleanup after fork or promotion must use `specflowctl process cleanup-success` when that deterministic entry exists; without that tool-backed cleanup result, the command must not claim deterministic cleanup closure
6. a cleanup target that is already absent is a recorded missing cleanup target, not a different recovery decision

## 5. Stable-Side Recovery Baseline

For stable-side invalidation:

1. do not generate candidate-side cleanup solely because stable alignment became stale
2. update `_status.md` so the stable verification command becomes the next legal step

Default stable fallback targets:

1. invalid `unit` stable -> `unit_stable_verify`
2. invalid `scenario` stable -> `scenario_stable_verify`

## 6. Incomplete Promotion Recovery

### 6.1 Required Recovery Baseline Before Mutation

Before the first truth-file mutation, every promote command must capture a recovery baseline covering every file the round may overwrite or delete.

At minimum:

1. the target object row in `docs/specs/_status.md`
2. the target object's candidate truth file
3. the target object's stable truth file if it already existed
4. the target object's current-round process files
5. any appendix, shared, or global-rule file that the round may mutate, promote, absorb, or delete

Object-specific minimums:

1. `unit_promote`
   - `docs/specs/units/candidate/c_unit_{unit}.md`
   - `docs/specs/units/stable/s_unit_{unit}.md` when present
   - `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`
   - `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`
   - `_plans/active/{unit}.md`
   - `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
   - every same-round stable landing retargeted unit candidate main file when `unit_promote` changes that unit's `rule_refs`
   - every same-round stable landing retargeted unit candidate process file that may be deleted by post-promotion rule impact reconciliation
   - every surviving candidate file that references `c_unit_{unit}.md` through a known candidate-to-candidate file reference, because unit_promote deletes that target file and must be able to restore the cross-referencing file's original reference if incomplete-promotion recovery is required
   - every unit or scenario Spec file under `docs/specs/units/**` or `docs/specs/scenarios/**` that may be mechanically retargeted from `c_unit_{unit}` to `s_unit_{unit}` during promotion dependency reference retargeting
   - every `_status.md` row that may be changed because a retargeted current-layer stable object must run stable verification or a retargeted current-layer candidate object must fall back to check
   - every current-round process file that may be deleted because a retargeted candidate unit or scenario can no longer reuse process state written against the old candidate dependency reference
2. `scenario_promote`
   - `docs/specs/scenarios/candidate/c_scenario_{scenario}.md`
   - `docs/specs/scenarios/stable/s_scenario_{scenario}.md` when present
   - `_check_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`
   - `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`

Rules:

1. the baseline must preserve exact file bytes
2. the baseline may live in memory or an executor-owned temporary artifact
3. it is not repository truth and must not be committed

### 6.2 When Recovery Is Required

Incomplete promotion recovery is required when both are true:

1. the promote command already mutated at least one promotion target or deletion target
2. the round can no longer safely complete

Examples:

1. the command was interrupted after writing a new stable file
2. downstream reconciliation became blocked after partial promotion writeback
3. cleanup started but did not finish
4. post-promotion `rule_sync` or `impact_sync` showed that the repository cannot yet claim a stable closed state

### 6.3 Recovery Procedure

When incomplete promotion recovery is triggered:

1. stop claiming promotion success
2. restore every mutated or deleted file covered by the recovery baseline to its exact pre-mutation state
3. delete any new file created only by the interrupted round that did not exist in the recovery baseline
4. restore `_status.md` for the target object to candidate semantics:
   - keep `Candidate=yes`
   - keep `Active Layer=candidate`
   - set the smallest restart step to:
     - `unit -> unit_check`
     - `scenario -> scenario_check`
5. keep `Stable=yes|no` consistent with the pre-round state from the recovery baseline
6. after repository restoration, delete candidate-side process files for that target object because they are no longer safe for reuse

### 6.4 Recovery Result

After incomplete promotion recovery completes, the only safe claim is:

1. promotion did not complete
2. repository truth was restored to the pre-promotion candidate round
3. the object must restart from its candidate closure step

The command must not claim:

1. that the new stable truth is active
2. that old verify evidence is still reusable
3. that the round can resume from a later step than the family restart step

### 6.5 Rule-Governance Recovery

Required when a rule-governance flow (rule_new, rule_extract, rule_bind, rule_topology) has already mutated rule truth files, repository_mapping.md, or downstream unit/scenario candidate files, and rule_sync returns control to rule_escape before the flow can safely close.

#### 6.5.1 Required Recovery Baseline Before Mutation

Before the first file write in any rule-governance flow that may mutate:

1. the target candidate-layer Rule file(s)
2. any stable-layer sibling Rule file that may be created, updated, or deleted
3. any downstream unit or scenario candidate file that may be rewritten (rule_refs, body text)
4. `docs/specs/repository_mapping.md` when the round may change the rule object map
5. every other file under `docs/specs/rules/**` that may be touched by this round
6. every candidate-side process file for each downstream unit or scenario candidate file that the round may rewrite or invalidate
   - unit: `_check_result/unit/{unit}.md`, `_plans/draft/{unit}.md`, `_plans/active/{unit}.md`, `_verify_result/unit/{unit}.md`
   - scenario: `_check_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`, `_verify_result/scenario/{scenario}.md`

#### 6.5.2 When Recovery Is Required

Rule-governance recovery is required when both are true:

1. the rule flow already mutated at least one rule-truth file, repository_mapping.md file, or downstream unit/scenario file
2. rule_sync returns control to rule_escape because repository truth is insufficient to continue safely

#### 6.5.3 Recovery Procedure

1. stop claiming the rule flow succeeded
2. restore every mutated file covered by the recovery baseline to its exact pre-mutation state
3. delete any new file created only by the interrupted round that did not exist in the recovery baseline
4. if `repository_mapping.md` was modified, restore it from the recovery baseline
5. for every downstream unit or scenario candidate file restored by Step 2, handle candidate-side process files deterministically:
   - restore each covered process file to its exact pre-mutation bytes when it existed in the recovery baseline
   - delete each process file created after the recovery baseline
   - delete each process file whose exact pre-mutation bytes cannot be proven from the recovery baseline
   - use the Section 4 `truth_layer` cleanup target for that object when deletion is required
   - do not keep any process file written against the interrupted rule-governance mutation

#### 6.5.4 Recovery Result

After rule-governance recovery completes:

1. all rule-truth files are restored to pre-mutation state
2. `repository_mapping.md` is restored to pre-mutation state when it was touched
3. any downstream unit/scenario candidate file modified by the interrupted round is restored
4. the next action is rerunning natural-language routing from current repository truth

## 7. Reason Codes

This policy adds one standardized recovery code:

1. `promotion_recovery`
   - use only when a promote command already mutated repository truth and the round had to be restored
2. `rule_governance_recovery`
   - use only when a rule-governance flow already mutated rule truth, repository_mapping, or downstream unit/scenario files and rule_sync returned control to rule_escape

Other fallback or drift cases keep using the existing standardized handoff codes.

## 8. Relationship To Other Files

This policy works together with:

1. `specflow/framework/command_policy.md`
2. `specflow/framework/impact_sync_policy.md`
3. `specflow/framework/checkpoint_protocol.md`
4. the active promote command file

Priority rules:

1. the active command decides whether recovery is entered
2. `impact_sync` may execute deterministic fallback cleanup
3. this file defines the repository-restoration baseline once recovery is required

## 9. Non-Goals

This file does not:

1. create new lifecycle stages
2. define a general rollback system for arbitrary code edits outside the active command scope
3. replace git-history policy
