# Spec-Driven Development Policy

## 1. Purpose

This file defines how formal module Specs and the global system-constraints Spec work in this repository.

It answers four questions:

1. which objects make up the formal module Spec system and the global system-constraints Spec
2. which files carry those objects
3. how an agent should read and use those files before implementation, review, or promotion
4. what kind of `candidate` Spec is sufficient to drive planning and implementation

This is a direct rule document for executors. It does not depend on unwritten conversation context.

---

## 2. Core Objects

### 2.1 Version Layers

Formal modules have two version layers by default:

1. `stable`
   - the currently effective formal truth for the module
2. `candidate`
   - the candidate truth prepared for the next version

These layers answer:

1. what the current formal baseline is
2. whether the current work is aligning the formal version or advancing the next version

### 2.2 System Constraints

`system_constraints` is the unique global system-constraint object.
It is not a normal module and does not enter `docs/specs/_status.md`.

It answers:

1. what the formally recognized technical baseline of the project is
2. which shared mechanisms the project should prefer to reuse
3. what default solution the project should prefer for certain engineering problems
4. which global practices are forbidden and which exceptions must be explicitly recorded

It does not answer:

1. how one module's internal state machine should be designed
2. how one module's implementation should be split into functions
3. what the full system topology must look like all at once

It has only one formally effective layer:

1. `docs/specs/system/stable/s_system_constraints.md`

It has no independent `_check_result`, `_plans`, or `_verify_result`.
It also has no independent candidate file.

Lifecycle rules:

1. it is not a command target; users should not execute `*:system_constraints`
2. when a module command needs the formal technical baseline, shared mechanisms, or global exceptions, and the file exists, it must read `docs/specs/system/stable/s_system_constraints.md`
3. modules may propose new global constraints only in their own `candidate`
4. `s_system_constraints.md` may be created or updated only during module `cand_promote:{module}`
5. therefore, `system_constraints` evolves through module command chains instead of an independent command chain

### 2.3 Module

`module_xxx` is the formal module name.
It is the only stable module identifier used by command entry and the status table. It is not the same as a file name.

### 2.4 Module Spec File

Each module has exactly one formal Spec file per version layer:

1. `stable` -> `s_{module}.md`
2. `candidate` -> `c_{module}.md`

A formal Spec file must cover at least:

1. module goal and boundary
2. key terminology
3. data structures and protocols
4. state machine and main flow
5. edge cases and error handling
6. verifiability and acceptance criteria

### 2.5 Formal Module vs Supporting File

Spec files in the repository are divided into three categories:

1. formal module files
2. single-module supporting expansion files
3. shared supporting expansion files

#### 2.5.1 Formal Module Files

An object counts as a formal module only when all of the following hold:

1. it has a stable module name such as `module_xxx`
2. it is a legal target of `{command}:{module}`
3. it is registered as a formal module row in `docs/specs/_status.md`
4. it has its own formal Spec file for the relevant layer
5. that main Spec file itself satisfies the minimum content requirements instead of outsourcing core truth to supporting files for the long term

Being placed under `docs/specs/candidate/` or having a module-like file name is not enough by itself.

#### 2.5.2 Single-Module Supporting Expansion Files

These include appendix files, topic expansions, Prompt source templates, extra examples, or expanded explanations of complex objects for one module.

Rules:

1. they support a formal module but do not enter the command chain independently
2. they must not enter `docs/specs/_status.md` independently
3. they must not produce their own `_check_result`, `_plans`, or `_verify_result`
4. once explicitly referenced by the main module body, they enter the truth-reading surface of that layer
5. executors must not read the main file while skipping an explicitly referenced supporting file

Directory rules:

1. candidate supporting files belong under `docs/specs/candidate/appendix/` or an equivalent dedicated subdirectory
2. stable supporting files belong under `docs/specs/stable/appendix/` or an equivalent dedicated subdirectory
3. the roots of `docs/specs/candidate/` and `docs/specs/stable/` should normally contain only main module files
4. if a supporting file remains in a root directory, that is directory drift
5. the first standard command that discovers that drift during mandatory checks must fix it before continuing

Frontmatter rules:

1. use `module: module_xxx`
2. use `layer: stable | candidate`
3. use `spec_version_ref: s_{module}@... | c_{module}@...`
4. do not use `id: module_xxx` because that is too easily misread as an independent formal module identifier

#### 2.5.3 Shared Supporting Expansion Files

Shared Appendix files are not formal modules. They are shared truth objects reused by multiple formal modules.

Examples include:

1. shared protocol text
2. shared output protocols
3. shared object-expansion text
4. shared failure semantics
5. shared few-shot or reuse-boundary descriptions

Rules:

1. they are not legal `{command}:{module}` targets
2. they may exist at both `candidate` and `stable`
3. they enter a module's truth-reading surface only when explicitly bound in that module's current-layer `Global Constraint Alignment.shared_appendix_refs`
4. their lifecycle depends on the command chains of modules that bind them
5. `bound_modules` is only a declaration of which modules the current text is expected to serve; it does not replace formal binding semantics

Shared-boundary rules:

1. `shared` does not mean "might be reused later"; it means "multiple formal modules depend on one truth that should have exactly one formal definition"
2. the first appearance of content should stay in the current module body or appendix by default
3. only when a second formal module needs the same formal truth does the content become a shared candidate
4. if content is only thematically similar or structurally similar, it is not shared
5. use one shared object per shared file
6. do not permanently stuff unrelated shared topics into one umbrella shared file
7. use `specflow/framework/docs/agent_guidelines/shared_extract_review.md` for formal shared-boundary review

Shared directory rules:

1. candidate shared files belong under `docs/specs/shared/candidate/`
2. stable shared files belong under `docs/specs/shared/stable/`
3. they must not remain under one module's appendix path pretending to be module-local appendix files
4. if such directory drift is found, the discovering standard command must migrate the file and fix bindings before continuing

Shared reading, invalidation, and cleanup rules:

1. if `shared_appendix_refs` is not empty, executors must read the bound Shared Appendix files together with the module's current-layer truth
2. `cand_check`, `cand_plan`, `cand_impl`, `cand_verify`, `stable_verify`, and `spec_fork` must not skip bound Shared Appendix files
3. if a bound Shared Appendix's body, version reference, or binding relation changes, all module candidate-side process files still carrying the old snapshot become invalid and fall back to `cand_check`
4. if a stable Shared Appendix changes, any claim that a module still aligns with `stable` must be re-read and re-judged
5. Shared Appendix files are not cleaned up merely because one module finished promotion; they may be cleaned only when no module still binds them, when they are replaced by newer shared files, or when their stable conclusions have been fully absorbed into the formal global baseline
6. if `bound_modules` diverges from the real set implied by module `shared_appendix_refs`, that is governance drift and must be repaired by the command responsible for the binding change
7. any task that changes `docs/specs/shared/**` or any module's `shared_appendix_refs` must complete Shared Appendix state reconciliation before claiming the state is closed

Shared frontmatter should include at least:

1. `shared_id: shared_xxx`
2. `layer: stable | candidate`
3. `shared_version: <semver>`
4. `bound_modules`
5. `system_constraints_stable_ref`

---

## 3. `_status.md`

`docs/specs/_status.md` is the formal module status table.

It records only current state facts. It does not carry governance rules.

At minimum, each formal module row answers:

1. whether `stable` exists
2. whether `candidate` exists
3. which layer is active now
4. what the default next command is
5. any concise note explaining why that next command is the smallest actionable step

Executors must consume `_status.md` as the state index for module routing and fallback decisions.

---

## 4. Minimum Requirements For A Formal Module Spec

A formal module main Spec must be self-sufficient enough to drive downstream work.

At minimum it must define:

1. context and motivation
2. terminology
3. data structures or protocols
4. state machine or main business flow
5. edge cases and error handling
6. testability and acceptance criteria

It must not rely on unwritten chat context, author memory, or vague README vision as the real basis for behavior.

---

## 5. Candidate Adequacy

A `candidate` is sufficient for downstream planning and implementation only when both are true:

1. `progressability`
   - the candidate is clear enough to stably enter planning and implementation
2. `content completeness`
   - the key behavior truth that affects implementation results has been formally acknowledged in the candidate

For `cand_check`, missing items should be understood in three layers:

1. `critical`
   - if missing, implementation results may change or different executors may make different external behaviors
2. `important`
   - does not directly change results now, but meaningfully harms review stability, maintenance, or future closure
3. `elaboration`
   - affects readability or presentation only

If progressability fails or any critical completeness gap remains, the candidate must not pass.

---

## 6. Global Constraint Alignment

When a module involves technical choices, shared infrastructure, cross-module reuse, global exceptions, or system-level proposals, its current-layer Spec should explicitly include `Global Constraint Alignment` or an equivalent section.

At minimum that section should cover:

1. `system_constraints_stable_ref`
2. `shared_appendix_refs`
3. `shared_mechanism_reuse_summary`
4. `global_constraint_exceptions`
5. `proposed_system_constraints_updates`
6. `promotion_to_system_stable`

Rules:

1. if the formal global baseline exists, `system_constraints_stable_ref` must equal the current stable system-constraint version
2. if no formal global baseline exists yet, it must be `none`
3. if the module behavior depends on Shared Appendix truth, `shared_appendix_refs` must bind it explicitly
4. if the module deviates from global constraints or Shared Appendix truth, that deviation must be written explicitly instead of implied

---

## 7. Process Files

Process files are not behavior truth. They are execution artifacts.

The main process files are:

1. `_check_result/{module}.md`
2. `_plans/{module}.md`
3. `_verify_result/{module}.md`

Their validity never depends on file existence alone.
They remain valid only when their binding fields still match the current candidate, the current global baseline state, and the current Shared Appendix snapshot when applicable.

When those bindings drift, the process file is invalid and the module must fall back to the smallest valid next command.

---

## 8. Pre-Execution Self-Check

Before implementation, review, verification, or promotion work, executors must perform the mandatory pre-checks required by the active command or policy.

At minimum, the pre-check should catch:

1. state drift
2. directory drift
3. outdated process-file bindings
4. missing required upstream truth files
5. invalid command progression against `Next Command`

If those checks fail, do not continue as if the command were still valid.

---

## 9. Lifecycle Closure Rules

The default closure logic is:

1. `stable`-side verification keeps or restores confidence in the current formal version
2. `candidate`-side work must move through `cand_check -> cand_plan -> cand_impl -> cand_verify -> cand_promote`
3. invalid process files force fallback to the smallest still-valid step
4. Shared Appendix changes may invalidate many modules at once and must be reconciled explicitly
5. formal promotion must clean the round's candidate files and process artifacts

Do not invent a second lifecycle outside these rules.

---

## 10. Executor Discipline

Executors must follow these defaults:

1. do not bypass `docs/specs/` and guess behavior from code or memory
2. when uncertain whether something is a behavior change, treat it as one
3. do not let code go first on behavior changes
4. read only the files required by the current task, but do read all files that the current rule makes mandatory
5. do not silently narrow review scope or command scope without user authorization or an explicit rule
