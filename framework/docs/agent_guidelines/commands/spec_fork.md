# Spec Fork Command

## 1. Purpose

This command forks a new `candidate` Spec from an existing `stable`.

Goals:

1. open a new candidate-design round from the current formal version
2. provide candidate truth for downstream `cand_check / cand_plan / cand_impl`
3. update `docs/specs/_status.md`

## 2. Scope

By default it handles:

1. a new upgrade round for a module that already has `stable`
2. deriving candidate truth from formal truth
3. initializing the current round's `system_constraints_stable_ref`

## 3. Preconditions

1. complete required pre-checks
2. `_status.md` says `Next Command=spec_fork`
3. the module already has `stable`
4. read any stable appendix files explicitly referenced by `s_{module}.md`
5. read bound stable Shared Appendix files if `shared_appendix_refs` is not empty
6. read the git policy if commit-triggering files may change
7. if Shared Appendix bindings will change or `docs/specs/shared/**` will change, read `shared_flow_reconcile.md`

## 4. Procedure

1. read `s_system_constraints.md` if it exists; otherwise continue with no formal global baseline
2. read `docs/specs/stable/s_{module}.md` and any explicitly referenced appendix files
3. read bound stable Shared Appendix files if any
4. determine the target formal version for this round:
   - compatible new capability -> next `MINOR`
   - incompatible change -> next `MAJOR`
   - compatible fix or alignment -> next `PATCH`
5. generate `docs/specs/candidate/c_{module}.md` from the current stable file
6. set candidate `frontmatter.version` to that target version
7. write `system_constraints_stable_ref`
8. re-check `shared_appendix_refs`:
   - if the formal global baseline exists, bind to the current version
   - otherwise write `none`
   - if the stable layer depended on stable shared files and the candidate still depends on them, create corresponding candidate shared files first and bind to those candidate-layer versions
   - if the current round no longer reuses shared appendix truth, or candidate-layer shared truth is not ready yet, write `shared_appendix_refs=none`
9. update Shared Appendix `bound_modules` if bindings changed
10. delete old `_check_result/{module}.md`, `_verify_result/{module}.md`, `_plans/{module}.md`, and previous-round candidate appendix files
11. if other modules were affected by Shared Appendix changes but not directly closed here, run `shared_flow_reconcile`
12. update `_status.md`:
   - `Stable=yes`
   - `Candidate=yes`
   - `Active Layer=candidate`
   - `Next Command=cand_check`
13. perform git close-out if required

## 5. Stop Conditions

1. the new `candidate` exists
2. previous-round process files are cleaned up
3. Shared Appendix side effects are closed
4. `_status.md` is updated

## 6. Output Contract

1. fork decision
2. created file path
3. initialized candidate version
4. written formal global baseline reference or `none`
5. cleanup result
6. git close-out result
7. `_status.md` update result

## 7. Non-Goals

1. directly modifying `stable`
2. directly generating a plan
3. directly entering implementation
4. creating an independent `system_constraints` candidate file
