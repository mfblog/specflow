# Checkpoint Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This file defines the structured checkpoint protocol used by `specflow` commands and governance flows that explicitly adopt checkpoint handling.

It answers five questions:

1. what a checkpoint is
2. which checkpoint types are allowed
3. which fields every checkpoint must carry
4. how checkpoint results must be resumed
5. what a checkpoint must never replace

This is a direct rule document for executors.

## 2. What A Checkpoint Is

A checkpoint is a structured communication stop raised by an active command or governance flow when it cannot close correctly without a small amount of human input or human judgment.

It is not:

1. a standard command
2. an independent state machine
3. a process file
4. a behavior source of truth

Plain meaning:

1. the active command or governance flow is still responsible for the workflow state
2. the checkpoint only formalizes the stop reason, the required user response, and the legal resume path

---

## 3. Allowed Checkpoint Types

Only these checkpoint types are allowed:

1. `clarification`
   - use when the missing blocker is user intent, scope boundary, or acceptance meaning that is not yet formally written into current truth
2. `decision`
   - use when more than one materially different direction remains viable and the user must choose one
3. `human_verify`
   - use when automation is insufficient to close confidence and a small amount of human effect judgment is still required
4. `prerequisite_action`
   - use when the active flow cannot legally continue until one explicit upstream command or repository writeback action is completed first

Type rules:

1. `clarification` and `decision` are allowed only where the active command file or governance-flow file explicitly permits them
2. `human_verify` is allowed only where the active command file or governance-flow file explicitly permits it
3. `prerequisite_action` is allowed only where the active command file or governance-flow file explicitly permits it
4. executors must not invent additional checkpoint types

---

## 4. Fixed Checkpoint Fields

Every checkpoint must include all of the following fields:

1. `type`
2. `blocking`
3. `command`
4. `unit`
5. `question_or_action`
6. `why_blocking`
7. `required_writeback_target`
8. `resume_signal`
9. `resume_next_step`

Field meanings:

1. `type`
   - one of the allowed checkpoint types
2. `blocking`
   - always records whether the current command is fully blocked pending user input
3. `command`
   - the active command or governance flow that raised the checkpoint
4. `unit`
   - the formal unit identifier
   - use literal `none` only when the active governance flow is not bound to exactly one formal unit, for example a cross-unit shared-governance checkpoint
5. `question_or_action`
   - the exact input or verification the user must provide
6. `why_blocking`
   - the minimal explanation of why the command cannot close correctly yet
7. `required_writeback_target`
   - where the checkpoint conclusion must be written before command resume, or `none` only when no truth writeback is required
8. `resume_signal`
   - what user response counts as the checkpoint being answered
9. `resume_next_step`
   - the smallest legal next step after the checkpoint is satisfied

---

## 5. Resume Rules

Checkpoint resume must follow these rules:

1. the active command does not become `pass` merely because a checkpoint was raised
2. the active command or governance flow must re-judge its gate conditions after resume instead of assuming the checkpoint answer fixed everything
3. if the checkpoint conclusion changes behavior truth, boundary truth, or acceptance truth, that conclusion must be written back to the current candidate, required appendix, shared-contract file, or other flow-declared truth target before resume
4. executors must not treat chat-only conclusions as durable truth
5. `resume_next_step` must be the smallest legal step, not the most convenient step

Writeback rules:

1. for `clarification`, `required_writeback_target` should normally be the current candidate main file, a required appendix file, or the active flow's declared shared-truth target
2. for `decision`, `required_writeback_target` should normally be the current candidate main file, a required appendix file, or the active flow's declared shared-truth target when the decision affects behavior truth
3. for `human_verify`, `required_writeback_target` may be `none` only when the checkpoint concerns final confidence rather than truth repair
4. for `prerequisite_action`, `required_writeback_target` should name the concrete truth or process target that must exist before resume, and `resume_next_step` should point to rerunning the active flow after that prerequisite is complete

---

## 6. Boundary Rules

Checkpoint usage is intentionally narrow.

Executors must not use checkpoints to:

1. bypass candidate truth writeback
2. hide an implementation bug as if it were only a user decision
3. replace required automated work with manual work
4. create a second workflow outside the command chain
5. keep asking open-ended preference questions that do not materially affect the active command

Additional type boundaries:

1. `clarification` is not a substitute for missing technical investigation
2. `decision` is not a substitute for executor reluctance to recommend the best option
3. `human_verify` is not a substitute for tests, static checks, or implementation verification that the executor could have performed
4. `prerequisite_action` is not a substitute for an avoidable executor task; use it only when the current flow truly depends on a separate formal command or writeback target that cannot be skipped

---

## 7. Command Relationship

The checkpoint protocol works together with:

1. `specflow/framework/docs/agent_guidelines/command_policy.md`
2. `specflow/framework/docs/agent_guidelines/candidate_handoff_contract.md`
3. the active command file or governance-flow file

Priority rules:

1. the active command file or governance-flow file decides whether that flow may raise a checkpoint and which types are legal
2. `command_policy.md` decides command-level progression and fallback rules
3. this file defines the common structure and resume semantics of checkpoints

---

## 8. Non-Goals

This file does not:

1. create new standard commands
2. define behavior truth for any module
3. authorize executors to keep truth in chat instead of files
4. replace `_check_result`, `_plans`, or `_verify_result`
