# Atom System

The Atom System manages shared governance content that appears identically across multiple
framework files. Instead of copy-pasting the same content into every file (creating
maintenance drift), content is defined once in an atom source file and generated into all
target files via deterministic scripts.

## Why Atoms Exist

The specFlow governance framework has documented procedural content that must appear in
multiple files simultaneously (Section 2.12 self-containment requirement). Examples include
the manual command close procedure (5 Context Cards), rule governance shared footer (6 rule
files), and the guidance scenario list (5 files).

Without atoms, updating any shared content requires editing every affected file manually —
a maintenance risk that has already produced documented drift (see `spec_flow_review:full`
findings F-001, F-002, and related P2/P3 findings).

With atoms:
1. **Edit once** — change the atom source file.
2. **Generate** — run `./generate.sh` to propagate the change to all target files.
3. **Verify** — run `./verify.sh` to confirm all targets match.

## How Target Files Reference Atoms

Target files use marker lines to declare where atom content lives:

```
==ATOM_BEGIN:atom_id==
(content between markers is managed by the atom system — DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY)
==ATOM_END:atom_id==
```

**Rules:**
- The content between `==ATOM_BEGIN:==` and `==ATOM_END:==` is owned by the atom system.
- Do NOT manually edit content between atom markers. Edit the atom source file instead, then run `generate.sh`.
- Content outside atom markers is NOT managed by the atom system and may be edited freely.
- Each atom_id may appear exactly once per target file.
- The marker lines must appear on their own lines with no leading/trailing whitespace.

## Usage

### Adding a New Atom

1. Create the atom source file under `framework/_atoms/<category>/<name>.md` with the shared content.
2. Add a row to `manifest.txt`:
   ```
   <atom_id> | <category>/<name>.md | <target1>,<target2>,...
   ```
3. Add `==ATOM_BEGIN:<atom_id>==` and `==ATOM_END:<atom_id>==` markers to each target file at the desired injection point.
4. Run `./generate.sh` to populate the markers with atom content.
5. Run `./verify.sh` to confirm correctness.

### Modifying Existing Atom Content

1. Edit the atom source file (`framework/_atoms/<category>/<name>.md`).
2. Run `./generate.sh` to propagate the change to all target files.
3. Run `./verify.sh` to confirm all targets match.
4. Commit both the atom source change AND the target file changes together.

### Verifying Atom Integrity

Run `./verify.sh` at any time to check whether all target files contain the
correct atom content. This should be run:
- After any framework governance changes
- Before committing changes that touch governance files
- As part of CI if the repository has one
- As part of `spec_flow_review` (see the atom verification standard)

### Removing an Atom

1. Remove the atom row from `manifest.txt`.
2. Remove the `==ATOM_BEGIN:==` / `==ATOM_END:==` markers from all target files.
   The content between markers stays in the file (it becomes locally owned).
3. Optionally delete the atom source file if no longer needed.

## Contract

1. The atom source file is the **single canonical source** for the shared content.
2. `generate.sh` is **deterministic and idempotent** — running it twice produces identical output.
3. `verify.sh` is **deterministic** — same input always produces the same pass/fail result.
4. `manifest.txt` is the **authoritative registry** of all atom → target mappings.
5. The atom system is **layout-agnostic** — all paths in `manifest.txt` are repository-root relative.
6. Atom markers are inert markdown — they do not affect rendering or execution.

## Relationship to Managed Blocks

The existing `==SPECFLOW:BEGIN==` / `==SPECFLOW:END==` managed block system (used for
template entry files) is separate from the atom system. Managed blocks are consumed
by `specflowctl` Go tooling for project-instance entry file synchronization. Atom markers
are consumed by `generate.sh` / `verify.sh` for framework governance file content
synchronization. They coexist independently.
