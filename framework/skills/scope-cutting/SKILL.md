description: Use when a requested project or feature is too broad for one candidate round, mixes independent capabilities, or needs a first useful version before formal candidate truth can be written safely.

# Scope Cutting

## Purpose

Use this skill to reduce a broad idea into the smallest useful candidate round.

The output is a discussion-stage scope decision. It becomes durable only after candidate Spec writeback.

## Process

1. Separate the full vision from the first candidate round.
2. Identify independent capabilities that should not be forced into one unit or scenario change.
3. Identify whether the first useful proof is a local capability result, a trigger-to-outcome flow, a rule, a stable g_ rule, or a structure/ownership decision.
4. Recommend the smallest version that can prove the user-facing goal.
5. State what is explicitly out of scope for this round.
6. If multiple formal owners are plausible, stop and route through repository mapping or the relevant specFlow boundary rule instead of guessing.
7. Do not ask the user to choose an internal owner name when the real missing input is the desired outcome, local boundary, or success criterion.

## Output Shape

1. `full_vision`
2. `first_round_scope`
3. `explicit_non_goals`
4. `later_round_candidates`
5. `recommended_first_round`
6. `why_this_round_is_first`
7. `candidate_writeback_items`
8. `plain_language_next_question`

## Boundaries

1. Do not hide future work inside the current round.
2. Do not use scope cutting to avoid required Rule or global rule routing.
3. Do not let an oversized scope enter `unit_check` as if it were already closed.
