# Spec Flow Design Review

## 1. Purpose

`spec_flow_design_review` reviews whether the current `specFlow` design is a sound human-serving governance system.
This file owns the only `spec_flow_design_review` mode: the default full-scope design-baseline review.
Ordinary or plain exact `spec_flow_design_review` entry routes through `framework/governance/review.md` first, then enters this file.
It must not be narrowed into `scoped_review`.

It answers five questions:

1. whether the main governance design solves real repository problems rather than self-created process problems
2. whether the object boundaries, lifecycle order, and gate structure still fit real work shape
3. whether the governance chain creates real downstream control instead of only adding formal steps
4. whether the design remains operable for normal users and executors without excessive mental or operational burden
5. whether the repository may still claim that the current `specFlow` design is worth using as designed

Plain exact `spec_flow_design_review` starts the full-scope design-baseline review.
It uses the run-state, baseline slice table, dynamic risk slice table, score state, hard-blocker rules, and pass gate defined in this file.

This flow does not replace `spec_flow_review`.
`spec_flow_review` answers whether the governance rule set still closes coherently.
`spec_flow_design_review` answers whether that governance design is still reasonable and usable for humans.

This flow does not review business truth by default.
It reviews the design of the governance mechanism that governs business truth.

## 2. Default Scope

This section applies to every `spec_flow_design_review`.

The default scope includes the design main chain only.
It is layout-normalized:

1. `installed_project`
   - framework root: `specflow/framework/`
   - template root: `specflow/templates/`
   - tooling root: `specflow/tooling/`
   - project-instance compatibility mode: real project `docs/specs/`
2. `source_repo`
   - framework root: `framework/`
   - template root: `templates/`
   - tooling root: `tooling/`
   - project-instance compatibility mode: template bootstrap compatibility under `templates/docs/specs/`

`specflowctl review ... --layout auto` detects the layout. `--layout installed` and `--layout source` are explicit overrides.
When auto detection finds both layouts, the review must stop and require an explicit layout.

That default scope includes:

1. core governance and boundary rules
   - `spec_flow_design_review.md`
   - `governance/review.md`
   - `governance/review_scope.md`
   - `agent_operability_standard.md`
   - `spec_policy.md`
   - `lifecycle/overview.md`
   - `advance_policy.md`
   - `operations/entry_routing.md`
   - `operations/migration.md`
   - `onboarding_decision_policy.md`
   - `operations/implementation_change.md`
   - `core/repository_mapping.md`
   - `spec_writing_guide.md`
   - `candidate_intent_policy.md`
   - `candidate_intents/`
   - `operations/output_standard.md`
   - `slice_work_state_protocol.md`
   - `operations/entry_routing.md` and `governance/rule_system.md` where they define the rule-governance branch
2. lifecycle and gate-shape rules
   - active command contracts under `<framework-root>/lifecycle/*.md`
   - lifecycle Context Cards under `<framework-root>/lifecycle/*.md` are the active command contract
   - `candidate_handoff_contract.md`
   - `downgrade_policy.md`
   - `process_snapshot_contract.md`
   - `slice_work_state_protocol.md`
   - `lifecycle/recovery.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_status.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_check_work/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_check_result/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/draft/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/active/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_verify_result/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_stable_verify_result/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_governance_review/README.md`
3. human-entry rules
   - `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` for `installed_project`
   - `example.md` for `source_repo`
   - `<template-root>/AGENTS.md`
   - `<template-root>/GEMINI.md`
   - `<template-root>/CLAUDE.md`
   - `entry_index_registry.md`
   - `operations/output_standard.md`

The default scope excludes:

1. `tooling_execution_policy.md`
2. `<tooling-root>/README.md`
3. `<tooling-root>/bin/**`
4. `<tooling-root>/cmd/**`
5. `<tooling-root>/internal/**`
6. `governance/rules/rule_new.md`
7. `governance/rules/rule_extract.md`
8. `governance/rules/rule_bind.md`
9. `governance/rules/rule_topology.md`
10. `governance/rules/rule_sync.md`
11. `governance/rules/rule_escape.md`

If a conclusion, finding, or `pass` claim directly depends on one excluded file, the executor must explicitly widen scope first.
Do not claim that an excluded file supports the current design conclusion when that file was never made in-scope.

## 3. Review Blocks

For the default design-baseline review, the execution-local `review_plan` must use exactly these fixed review blocks:

1. `design_foundation`
   - `spec_flow_design_review.md`
   - `governance/review.md`
   - `governance/review_scope.md`
   - `agent_operability_standard.md`
   - `spec_policy.md`
   - `lifecycle/overview.md`
   - `advance_policy.md`
   - `operations/entry_routing.md`
   - `operations/migration.md`
   - `onboarding_decision_policy.md`
   - `operations/implementation_change.md`
   - `core/repository_mapping.md`
   - `spec_writing_guide.md`
   - `candidate_intent_policy.md`
   - `candidate_intents/`
   - `slice_work_state_protocol.md`
   - `operations/entry_routing.md` and `governance/rule_system.md` where they define the rule-governance branch
   - `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` for `installed_project`
   - `example.md` for `source_repo`
   - `<template-root>/AGENTS.md`
   - `<template-root>/GEMINI.md`
   - `<template-root>/CLAUDE.md`
2. `lifecycle_and_gate_design`
   - active command contracts under `<framework-root>/lifecycle/*.md`
   - lifecycle Context Cards under `<framework-root>/lifecycle/*.md`
   - `candidate_handoff_contract.md`
   - `downgrade_policy.md`
   - `process_snapshot_contract.md`
   - `slice_work_state_protocol.md`
   - `lifecycle/recovery.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_status.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_check_work/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_check_result/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/draft/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_plans/active/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_verify_result/README.md`
   - `<template-root>/docs/specs/_stable_verify_result/README.md`
   - `operations/output_standard.md`
3. `human_operability_and_extension`
   - `entry_index_registry.md`
   - `operations/output_standard.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` for `installed_project`
   - `example.md` for `source_repo`
   - `<template-root>/AGENTS.md`
   - `<template-root>/GEMINI.md`
   - `<template-root>/CLAUDE.md`

Onboarding and evidence appendix design must be judged as part of `design_foundation`.
The review must judge whether that design solves the real historical-project and partially implemented project onboarding problem, avoids creating an unnecessary lifecycle state, keeps evidence separate from implementation truth, and makes the current position and next action understandable to normal users and executors.

Project-instance migration design must be judged as part of `design_foundation`.
The review must judge whether `spec_flow_migrate` solves the real framework-update migration problem without turning old-format compatibility into a permanent second path, without hiding business-truth decisions inside mechanical updates, and without adding a heavier workflow than project-instance format migration requires.

## 4. Required Cross-Block Convergence Checks

For the default design-baseline review, the minimum cross-block convergence checks are:

1. `design_foundation <-> lifecycle_and_gate_design`
2. `design_foundation <-> human_operability_and_extension`
3. `lifecycle_and_gate_design <-> human_operability_and_extension`

The review must include all three design blocks before any `pass` or `pass-with-optimization` conclusion.
If one of those block boundaries is not reviewed, the review must stop without a passing conclusion.

## 5. Preconditions

### 5.1 Full-Scope Review Run State

`spec_flow_design_review` adopts `<framework-root>/slice_work_state_protocol.md` for its review run-state file.
This review file owns the adoption details, design review blocks, scoring model, hard-blocker rules, optimization rules, and final conclusion rules.

Every `spec_flow_design_review` uses a run-state process file.

The process file is not a Spec, not durable behavior truth, and not a substitute for the review output.
It records review progress, baseline slice status, dynamic risk slice status, score-state progress, input fingerprints, findings, non-blocking optimization references, blocked reason, and resume position for one full-scope design review run.

The run-state path is:

```text
docs/specs/_governance_review/spec_flow_design_review.md
```

`review_run_id` is a field inside the run-state file.
It must use this shape:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-default_design_baseline
```

Final review conclusions map to run-state status values as follows:

1. `pass` -> `closed_pass`
2. `pass-with-optimization` -> `closed_pass_with_optimization`
3. `blocked` -> `closed_blocked`

All three mapped status values are closed run states.
The startup procedure must delete any closed run state before creating a new full-scope default design review run.

There must be at most one `spec_flow_design_review` run-state file in the repository at any time.
Starting a new full-scope default design review must delete the previous `spec_flow_design_review` run-state file before writing the new run state.
The file name must not contain the run ID, because the run ID identifies the review round inside the file rather than creating a history archive.

Rules:

1. every `spec_flow_design_review` must use this run-state file procedure
2. the run-state file must not replace the fixed review blocks, the eight fixed design questions, the hard-blocker rules, or the pass gate
3. deterministic tooling may maintain only mechanical fields:
   - UTC timestamps
   - `review_layout`
   - baseline slice skeleton rows
   - score-state skeleton rows
   - input fingerprints
   - structural validation
   - stale status changes caused by changed or missing input files
4. deterministic tooling must not write or modify:
   - question scores
   - `score_basis`
   - design finding content
   - finding severity
   - non-blocking optimization content
   - hard-blocker judgment
   - final `pass | pass-with-optimization | blocked` conclusion
5. the startup procedure must inspect only `docs/specs/_governance_review/spec_flow_design_review.md`
6. if the fixed run-state file does not exist, the startup procedure must create a new run-state file and begin at `design_foundation`
7. if the fixed run-state file is closed or structurally invalid, the startup procedure must delete it, report the deletion reason, create a new run-state file, and begin at `design_foundation`
8. if the fixed run-state file is valid, open, and last updated no more than two hours before startup, the startup procedure may reuse it automatically; before review work continues, the executor must refresh fingerprints, mark stale slices, and resume from the recorded active slice
9. if the fixed run-state file is valid, open, and last updated more than two hours but no more than seven days before startup, the startup procedure must stop for an explicit manual decision to either reuse the file or delete it and start a new run
    - if the decision is reuse, the executor must refresh fingerprints, mark stale slices, and resume from the recorded active slice
    - if the decision is delete, the startup procedure must delete the file, create a new run-state file, and begin at `design_foundation`
10. if the fixed run-state file is valid, open, and last updated more than seven days before startup, the startup procedure must delete it as expired, report the deletion reason, create a new run-state file, and begin at `design_foundation`
11. the startup procedure must not scan a per-flow subdirectory or preserve old closed run-state files as review history

Design-review adoption rules:

1. the state carrier for the default full-scope review is `docs/specs/_governance_review/spec_flow_design_review.md`
2. required run-state fields, baseline slice rows, dynamic risk slice rows, and score-state rows are defined in this file
3. baseline slices are defined in Section 5.2
4. dynamic risk slices are allowed only under Section 5.3
5. required cross-block convergence checks are defined in Section 4 and represented by the applicable baseline or dynamic risk slices
6. freshness and stale handling are performed through the review run-state procedure
7. slice-set closure can support `pass` or `pass-with-optimization` only when the hard-blocker review, scoring model, group checks, weighted score, findings review, optimization review, and cross-block convergence also pass
8. missing design truth, unclear in-scope ownership, or excluded-scope dependency gaps must become a dynamic risk slice, finding, optimization, blocked result, or explicit scope stop; they must not be hidden as ordinary score evidence

Structural validation rule:

1. `review run-validate --flow spec_flow_design_review --layout auto|installed|source` checks file shape, `review_layout`, and all fixed status values, including closed statuses; it is not a reuse decision.
2. closed run-state files may be structurally valid, but they are not open and must not be reused by startup.
3. freshness refresh applies only to an open run-state file.
4. `review run-refresh --flow spec_flow_design_review --layout auto|installed|source` is the authoritative entry for updating `input_fingerprint` and marking stale slices.
5. manual hashes, shell checksum output, editor display, temporary scripts, and conversation-derived values must not be written as `input_fingerprint` values or used to decide that a design-review slice remains fresh.
6. an explicit layout that conflicts with an existing open run-state file's `review_layout` must fail instead of rewriting that file.

### 5.2 Baseline Slice Catalog

For default full-scope `spec_flow_design_review`, the run-state baseline slice catalog is fixed.
These slices record review progress and input freshness only.
They do not replace the fixed design blocks or the scoring model.

The required baseline slices are:

1. `design_foundation`
   - tracks the fixed `design_foundation` review block from Section 3
2. `lifecycle_and_gate_design`
   - tracks the fixed `lifecycle_and_gate_design` review block from Section 3
3. `human_operability_and_extension`
   - tracks the fixed `human_operability_and_extension` review block from Section 3
4. `foundation_to_lifecycle_convergence`
   - tracks `design_foundation <-> lifecycle_and_gate_design`
5. `foundation_to_operability_convergence`
   - tracks `design_foundation <-> human_operability_and_extension`
6. `lifecycle_to_operability_convergence`
   - tracks `lifecycle_and_gate_design <-> human_operability_and_extension`
7. `scoring_and_pass_gate`
   - tracks whether the hard-blocker review, eight question scores, group averages, weighted score, and pass gate were completed by the executor

The final result must not issue `pass` or `pass-with-optimization` until every required baseline slice and every dynamic risk slice is closed as `passed` or `skipped_not_in_scope`.

### 5.3 Dynamic Risk Slices

Dynamic risk slices extend the fixed baseline slice catalog during execution.
They are required only when a design risk cannot be safely tracked by one existing baseline slice.

Rules:

1. a dynamic risk slice may be local or cross-convergence
2. a cross-block design risk must become a cross-convergence dynamic slice
3. a dynamic risk slice may only increase review coverage; it must not weaken or replace a baseline slice
4. a dynamic risk slice must be added before final conclusion when the executor discovers:
   - a cross-block design risk
   - a hard-blocker candidate that needs isolated review
   - an in-scope or excluded-scope dependency gap that affects a conclusion
   - a finding whose repair path needs separate re-review before final judgment
5. every dynamic risk slice must record the same slice fields used by the baseline slice table
6. dynamic risk slices do not create extra scoring questions and do not change the fixed weighting formula

### 5.4 Score State

The run-state file must contain a fixed `Score State` table with exactly eight rows: `q1` through `q8`.

Rules:

1. `Score State` records scoring progress only
2. the row IDs map directly to the eight questions in Section 7.1
3. tool-created rows start as `pending`
4. an executor may fill score values and evidence while performing the review
5. tooling may validate table shape and supported status values
6. tooling must not decide whether a score is correct, whether a score basis is sufficient, or whether the pass gate is satisfied

Before execution:

1. make the review scope explicit
2. build one execution-local `review_plan`
3. map in-scope files into the fixed review blocks
4. name the required cross-block convergence checks before final conclusions
5. explicitly confirm that the review stayed inside the design main chain and did not silently rely on excluded tooling or internal rule-flow files
6. create or reuse the run-state file from Section 5.1 before reviewing the first baseline slice

If any in-scope file cannot be assigned to a review block, do not issue `pass`.

## 6. Procedure

1. collect the in-scope governance files
2. execute the run-state startup procedure from Section 5.1
3. build the `review_plan`
4. review each fixed block for:
   - design necessity
   - human operability
   - gate usefulness
   - extension-surface cost
5. when a design risk concerns heavy gate structure, mandatory read chains, or required pre-action routing, judge whether the rule-consumption timing from Section 7.1 matches the work risk before scoring Questions 6, 7, or 8
6. run the `routine_work_path_check` from Section 7.1 when its trigger condition is met
7. when a design risk concerns avoidable rule weight, classify the affected rule text with the rule-weight classes from Section 7.1 before scoring Questions 6, 7, or 8
8. complete the required cross-block convergence checks
9. add required dynamic risk slices when newly discovered design risks cannot be tracked by an existing baseline slice
10. judge the hard-blocker set from Section 7.4 before any scoring-based `pass` claim
11. score all eight fixed design questions from Section 7.1
12. compute the fixed group averages from Section 7.2
13. compute the `weighted_score` from Section 7.3
14. separate blocking findings from non-blocking optimizations
   - every real finding must use the fixed finding contract from Section 8.1
   - every non-blocking optimization must use the optimization contract from Section 8.2
15. issue the final result only after baseline slices, dynamic risk slices, hard-blocker review, routine-work path check when triggered, question scoring, group checks, weighted-score calculation, findings review, optimization review, and cross-block convergence are all complete

## 7. Scoring Model

### 7.1 Fixed Design Questions

Every `spec_flow_design_review` must answer and score exactly these eight questions:

1. whether the mechanism solves a real problem
2. whether object boundaries follow real work shape
3. whether lifecycle steps are necessary and ordered for real progress
4. whether each gate creates real downstream gain
5. whether the mechanism rewards correct behavior instead of surface compliance
6. whether the mechanism's mental load is sustainably manageable
7. whether the operational cost matches the size of the work
8. whether the overall control gained is worth the overall cost

For every question, the output must report:

1. `score`
2. `score_basis`
3. `evidence`

Allowed score values are fixed:

1. `0`
   - clearly does not hold
2. `1`
   - weakly supported but materially unhealthy
3. `2`
   - basically holds but with clear burden, drift, or unresolved weakness
4. `3`
   - holds with only limited residual weakness
5. `4`
   - clearly holds with strong evidence

Rule-weight classification is part of design judgment for Questions 6, 7, and 8.
It does not create another review flow, another score group, or another output formula.

Rule-consumption timing is part of the same design judgment for Questions 6, 7, and 8.
It does not create another review flow, another score group, another lifecycle gate, or another output formula.

When a review identifies a heavy gate, mandatory read chain, or required pre-action routing path, classify the timing that preserves the required control as exactly one of these classes:

1. `action_before_hard_rule`
   - the rule must be consumed before action because violating it could change durable truth, object ownership, lifecycle advancement, implementation permission, rule truth, system truth, end-to-end verification claims, or another state that cannot be reliably detected and repaired after the action
2. `on_demand_rule_lookup`
   - the rule should be consumed when the executor reaches the uncertainty it governs because it guides judgment but does not itself authorize writes, forbid writes, advance state, or define closure
3. `post_action_check`
   - the rule may be checked after action when violation is mechanically detectable, automatically detectable, or detectable by a fixed evidence-review procedure before closure and can be repaired without letting drift become accepted truth

Rules:

1. `action_before_hard_rule` is required when late detection would let an unsafe write, false pass, wrong owner, skipped verification, or durable-truth drift become accepted.
2. `on_demand_rule_lookup` is preferred when the rule is only needed after a concrete uncertainty appears.
3. `post_action_check` is preferred when the same control can be enforced by a deterministic or reviewable check before closure.
4. a review must not classify a rule as `post_action_check` when the violation cannot be detected and repaired before closure.
5. a review must treat forced pre-action consumption as suspect when the rule can move to `on_demand_rule_lookup` or `post_action_check` without losing the control listed in Rule 1.

`routine_work_path_check` is mandatory when any of Questions 6, 7, or 8 is expected to score below `4` because of reading cost, rule weight, routine-work cost, full-chain path cost, mandatory read chains, heavy gate structure, or pre-action reading burden.

When triggered, `routine_work_path_check` must review these representative paths before any `pass` or `pass-with-optimization` conclusion:

1. routine implementation-only work
   - pure tests, logging, observability, mechanical refactor, or wording-only implementation support that does not change formal behavior truth
2. implementation repair under existing truth
   - a repair where current Spec truth already defines the intended behavior and the requested change should not invent new behavior
3. behavior, boundary, or acceptance change
   - a request that may change durable behavior truth, object ownership, lifecycle permission, acceptance criteria, rule truth, system truth, or end-to-end verification claims

For each reviewed path, the review must state:

1. the current pre-action read chain
2. the `B. Lightweight Pre-Action Prohibitions`
   - the three to five rules that must be known before action because violating them would create a risk that cannot be reliably detected and repaired after action
3. the `D. Minimum Allowed Action`
   - the smallest action the current request explicitly authorizes, with no scope expansion, new behavior, boundary change, acceptance change, or incidental repair beyond that request
4. the `E. Automatic Impact Check`
   - the automatic checks, deterministic checks, or fixed evidence-review procedures that can carry rule enforcement after action, including path ownership, state permission, rule truth impact, global rule impact, fallback-to-design need, and reroute to check, plan, or verify
   - a free-form reviewer assertion does not count as `E. Automatic Impact Check` unless it is backed by a named deterministic check or fixed evidence-review procedure
5. the timing decision for every rule currently consumed before action:
   - `action_before_hard_rule`
   - `on_demand_rule_lookup`
   - `post_action_check`
6. the concrete control that would be lost if a rule currently kept before action were moved later

Completion rules:

1. if `routine_work_path_check` is triggered but not performed, the review is incomplete and must not issue `pass`, `pass-with-optimization`, or `blocked`
2. if the check finds a smaller safe path and the final conclusion reports `optimization result: none`, the review is incomplete
3. if the check finds routine work forced through full pre-action rule consumption and no smaller B/D/E path exists in the design, the review must report a hard blocker
4. if the check cannot prove whether a rule is truly pre-action or safely later-consumable, classify that path as `possible_optimization_evidence_missing`; a `pass` conclusion must explain why the missing evidence does not hide an unsafe heavy path
5. if the check proves that every pre-action rule is `action_before_hard_rule` for the reviewed paths, the review may still pass when the fixed pass gate also passes

When a review identifies avoidable rule weight, classify the affected rule text as exactly one of these classes:

1. `hard_rule`
   - the rule is required because removing it could change durable truth, object ownership, lifecycle advancement, implementation permission, rule truth, system truth, or end-to-end verification claims
2. `judgment_guidance`
   - the rule helps an executor choose a route or evaluate risk, but it does not itself authorize writes, forbid writes, advance state, or define a stop condition
3. `example_or_wording`
   - the text exists only to make the rule easier to understand, and it is justified only when it removes a real execution ambiguity
4. `duplicate_or_restatement`
   - the text repeats another owner file without adding a local allowed action, forbidden action, stop condition, output requirement, dependency order, or scoring consequence
5. `overweight_rule`
   - the rule forces a heavier path than the work risk requires, forces pre-action consumption when `on_demand_rule_lookup` or `post_action_check` would preserve the same control, or applies a specialized structure to routine work where no durable-truth, ownership, shared, system, or end-to-end verification risk needs that structure

Rules:

1. accuracy has priority over lightness when a rule prevents durable truth drift, unsafe implementation, ambiguous ownership, skipped verification, or unrecoverable lifecycle advancement
2. lightness has priority once the same execution safety is already provided by another owner rule or by a smaller path
3. do not treat a rule as overweight only because it is long; treat it as overweight only when the extra reading or execution burden does not produce a distinct control gain
4. do not preserve duplicate text merely because it is familiar; preserve it only when deleting it would make the executor guess an owner, boundary, dependency, next action, or scoring consequence
5. if an in-scope rule is classified as `overweight_rule` or `duplicate_or_restatement` and does not create a hard blocker or finding, it must be reported as a non-blocking optimization instead of being hidden inside a residual score weakness

Question-specific scoring rules:

1. Question 1 must judge:
   - whether the target problem is explicit
   - whether that problem is real in repository work rather than self-created by the mechanism
   - whether the mechanism still has distinct value instead of duplicating another existing control
2. Question 2 must judge:
   - whether ownership and repair landing points are explicit
   - whether boundaries stay natural rather than artificially split
   - whether current object shape avoids repeated cross-object truth stitching
3. Question 3 must judge:
   - whether each lifecycle step corresponds to a real information change
   - whether the order reduces uncertainty rather than merely renaming state
   - whether the current sequence remains the smallest stable path
4. Question 4 must use only these four real-gain signals:
   - later ambiguity is materially reduced
   - the next step can start more directly
   - the rollback or repair landing point becomes clearer
   - the acceptance basis becomes more stable
   - score Question 4 by the number of confirmed signals hit in the current design, from `0` through `4`
5. Question 5 must judge:
   - whether the design rewards real clarification instead of document inflation
   - whether the design makes it easy to surface uncertainty instead of hiding it
   - whether the easiest way to pass the mechanism still aligns with real downstream quality
6. Question 6 must judge:
   - whether a normal user or executor can tell where they are
   - whether they can tell the next step and why it is the next step
   - whether the official documents, rather than author memory, carry the needed orientation
   - whether the in-scope rules force a normal user or executor to learn avoidable internal mechanism detail before they can understand current position, next action, and reason
   - whether `judgment_guidance`, `example_or_wording`, and `duplicate_or_restatement` content is kept small enough that it does not hide the governing hard rules
   - whether pre-action reading is limited to `action_before_hard_rule` material and does not hide the current next action behind rules that could safely be consumed on demand or checked after action
7. Question 7 must judge:
   - whether small changes have a smaller legal path than large changes
   - whether routine work avoids full-chain over-processing
   - whether the mechanism's operational steps scale with actual work size
   - whether `hard_rule` requirements are limited to cases where durable truth, ownership, lifecycle, implementation permission, rule truth, system truth, or end-to-end verification risk actually requires them
   - whether a specialized structure is optional or conditional when the current work does not need that structure for safe closure
   - whether routine work avoids mandatory full-chain pre-reading when an `on_demand_rule_lookup` or `post_action_check` path would preserve the same safety
8. Question 8 must judge:
   - whether the control gained is visible and repeatable
   - whether the documentation, learning, and execution cost stay proportionate to that gain
   - whether the mechanism still looks worth maintaining over time
   - whether each heavy gate or required read produces a distinct control gain that is not already produced by a smaller rule or owner file
   - whether each required pre-action read produces a distinct control gain that cannot be preserved by `on_demand_rule_lookup` or `post_action_check`
   - whether the recommended repair for excess rule weight is the smallest correct one: keep as `action_before_hard_rule`, downgrade to `on_demand_rule_lookup`, convert to `post_action_check`, keep only as `example_or_wording`, merge or link as `duplicate_or_restatement`, or remove or narrow an `overweight_rule`

When Question 6, 7, or 8 scores below `4`, the review must classify each cited weakness as one of:

1. `acceptable residual weakness`
   - use when the weakness is real but no clear, smaller, safe optimization is available without losing needed control
2. `non-blocking optimization`
   - use when a clear improvement exists, the current design still passes, and the issue does not trigger a hard blocker or pass-gate failure

The score basis for Questions 6, 7, and 8 must state which category applies.
If no non-blocking optimization is reported while any of those questions scores below `4`, the output must explain why every cited weakness is only an `acceptable residual weakness`.

### 7.2 Fixed Question Groups

The fixed score groups are:

1. `design_foundation`
   - Questions `1`, `2`, and `3`
2. `control_effectiveness`
   - Questions `4` and `5`
3. `human_operability`
   - Questions `6`, `7`, and `8`

Every review must compute and report the arithmetic average for each group.

### 7.3 Weighted Score

The fixed weights are:

1. Question `1` = `15`
2. Question `2` = `12`
3. Question `3` = `12`
4. Question `4` = `10`
5. Question `5` = `11`
6. Question `6` = `15`
7. Question `7` = `15`
8. Question `8` = `10`

The `weighted_score` formula is fixed:

```text
weighted_score = Σ(score / 4 × weight)
```

Do not invent alternate weighting formulas for this flow.

### 7.4 Hard-Blocker Rules

The following cases are hard blockers.
Any one of them forces the final conclusion to `blocked`, regardless of the weighted score:

1. the core mechanism cannot clearly explain which real problem it solves
2. boundary or lifecycle design leaves repair ownership or repair landing point unstable
3. any key gate has Question `4 = 0`
4. the mechanism clearly rewards surface compliance over real risk reduction
5. a normal user cannot rely on the official documents alone to know current position, next step, and why that step is next
6. the mechanism forces simple changes through a full heavy path when the work does not change durable truth, object ownership, lifecycle advancement, implementation permission, rule truth, system truth, or end-to-end verification obligations, and the design provides no smaller legal path
7. the mechanism forces simple changes through full pre-action rule consumption when a smaller `action_before_hard_rule`, `on_demand_rule_lookup`, or `post_action_check` path would preserve the same control, and the design provides no smaller legal path
8. a triggered `routine_work_path_check` proves that routine implementation-only work cannot be handled with lightweight pre-action prohibitions plus automatic impact checks, and the design provides no smaller legal path

### 7.5 Pass Gate

If no hard blocker exists, passing still requires all of the following:

1. no individual question score is below `2`
2. every fixed group average is at least `2.5`
3. `weighted_score` is at least `75`
4. when `routine_work_path_check` is triggered, the check is complete and its result is reflected in the hard-blocker result, findings result, optimization result, and Question 6, 7, and 8 score bases

When these pass-gate conditions hold:

1. use `pass` only when no non-blocking optimization exists
2. use `pass-with-optimization` when at least one non-blocking optimization exists

Otherwise the result is `blocked`.

## 8. Output Contract

This output contract applies to every `spec_flow_design_review`.

The output must report at least:

1. `review scope`
2. `review layout`
3. `framework root`, `template root`, `tooling root`, and `project-instance compatibility mode`
4. whether full-scope run state was created, reused, or deleted and recreated
5. the run-state file path
6. `review_plan`
7. the fixed review blocks used
8. the file coverage per block
9. the baseline slice table and slice statuses
10. the dynamic risk slice table and slice statuses, or explicit `none`
11. the score-state table
12. the stale slice result
13. the hard-blocker result
14. the `routine_work_path_check` result:
   - report `not_triggered` when the trigger condition did not apply
   - otherwise report each reviewed path, current pre-action read chain, B/D/E judgment, timing decisions, lost-control analysis, and whether the check found a hard blocker, non-blocking optimization, or missing evidence
15. all eight question scores, each with:
   - `score`
   - `score_basis`
   - `evidence`
16. the fixed group averages
17. the `weighted_score`
18. the cross-block convergence results
19. the findings result:
   - explicit `none` when no real finding exists
   - otherwise every finding must satisfy Section 8.1
20. the optimization result:
   - explicit `none` when no non-blocking optimization exists
   - otherwise every optimization must satisfy Section 8.2
21. when the final conclusion is `pass-with-optimization`, `why pass still holds`
22. when Question 6, 7, or 8 scores below `4` and no non-blocking optimization is reported for that question, the acceptable residual weakness explanation
23. the final conclusion:
   - `pass`
   - `pass-with-optimization`
   - `blocked`

If the output does not explicitly report Items 13 through 20, the review is not complete.
If the final conclusion is `pass-with-optimization` and the output omits Item 21, the review is not complete.

### 8.1 Finding Contract

When `spec_flow_design_review` reports a real finding, that finding must be written as one self-contained repairable unit.
A finding is reserved for a blocking design problem or a design problem that changes hard-blocker, score, group-average, weighted-score, or pass-gate judgment.
Non-blocking improvements must be reported under Section 8.2 instead of being mixed into findings.

The minimum required fields are:

1. `title`
2. `severity`
   - required for every real finding and must be one of `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, or `P3`
3. `affected_questions`
   - the exact question numbers from Section 7.1 that this finding harms
4. `score_impact`
   - the exact score consequence or pass-gate consequence caused by the finding
5. `background`
6. `what happened`
7. `impact`
8. `recommended fix`
9. `why this fix is the minimal correct fix`
10. `blocking`
11. `evidence`

Additional rules:

1. `severity` must satisfy the shared explanation baseline from `severity_policy.md`
2. `severity` explains design harm; it does not replace the fixed score model
3. `score` explains current design quality; it does not replace explicit blocking judgment
4. `P0` and `P1` are normally blocking; `P2` and `P3` are normally non-blocking unless the finding explains why the current review must stop
5. `recommended fix` must be specific enough that later repair work can execute it without a second clarification round
6. when a finding concerns avoidable rule weight or incorrect rule-consumption timing, `recommended fix` must state the smallest correct repair: keep as `action_before_hard_rule`, downgrade to `on_demand_rule_lookup`, convert to `post_action_check`, keep only as `example_or_wording`, merge or link as `duplicate_or_restatement`, or remove or narrow an `overweight_rule`
7. when a finding comes from `routine_work_path_check`, `recommended fix` must state whether the minimal repair is a lighter B rule set, a narrower D action boundary, an E automatic impact check, or a hard pre-action stop that the current design failed to isolate
8. when no real finding exists, the output must say so explicitly instead of omitting the finding section

### 8.2 Optimization Contract

When `spec_flow_design_review` reports a non-blocking optimization, that optimization must be written separately from findings.

A non-blocking optimization is allowed only when all of the following hold:

1. no hard blocker is triggered by the issue
2. the fixed pass gate still passes
3. the issue has a clear smaller improvement that preserves required governance control
4. the issue affects Question 6, 7, or 8, or concerns an in-scope `overweight_rule` or `duplicate_or_restatement`

The minimum required fields are:

1. `title`
2. `affected_questions`
3. `rule_weight_class`
4. `why non-blocking`
5. `recommended optimization`
6. `why this is the smallest correct optimization`
7. `evidence`

Rules:

1. `why non-blocking` must state why the issue does not trigger a hard blocker, score below `2`, group average failure, or weighted-score failure
2. `recommended optimization` must cut only the unnecessary rule weight or move it to the smallest safe consumption timing; it must not weaken a rule that prevents durable truth drift, ownership drift, implementation permission drift, shared or system drift, skipped verification, or false closure
3. when an optimization comes from `routine_work_path_check`, `recommended optimization` must name the affected path and specify whether the safe lighter shape is a smaller B rule set, `on_demand_rule_lookup`, `post_action_check`, or an added E automatic impact check
4. if the final conclusion is `pass-with-optimization`, at least one optimization item is required
5. if no non-blocking optimization exists, the output must say `optimization result: none`

## 9. Non-Goals

This flow does not:

1. replace `spec_flow_review`
2. replace the rule-governance branch
3. review business truth by default
4. review tooling source or binaries by default
5. create a new command chain
6. update `_status.md`
7. write `_check_result`, `_plans`, `_verify_result`, or `_stable_verify_result`
8. use checkpoints in v1
9. create a scoped or narrowed `spec_flow_design_review` mode
